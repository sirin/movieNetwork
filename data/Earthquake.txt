cem köksal'ın iki parça halindeki şarkısıdır. ilk kısım (earthquake part 1) teknik soloların olduğu pasajlarla doludur. ikinci kısım ise murat ilkan'n vokallerinin de yer aldığı bir hard&heavy şarkısıdır.
bir morgan heritage parçası. don't haffi dread albümünde ikamet ediyor. tadından yenmez. bi de iya waves cover'ını dinleyiniz. söyleyeceklerim bu kadar.
(bkz: cem koksal) when everyone was asleep the giant was waking up again three hours to dawn everybody's screaming trying to stand but surely you can't time to beg for your life don't you feel the power, it is devastating? thousands will be buried alive today don't you hear the sound of the ruthless slowly fading? crying won't change your undisputed fate it is the earthquake anger grows inside us turns to storm of hatred within we want you to groan buildings have filled graveyards was it worth forty-thousand lives? you are going to be damned don't you feel the anger of victims wrathfully growing? the chain of greed, they have always lied don't you hear the cries of the innocents fairly rising? who is to be hated, who deserves to be damned? it's not the earthquake it's not the earthquake!

aynı zamanda saved by the bell dördüncü sezon yirmi birinci bölümünün adı.
1970'li yıllarda hollywood'da moda olan felaket filmleri furyasından, mark robson'un yönetmiş olduğu 1974 tarihli film. charlton heston, ava gardner gibi önemli oyuncular barındırmasına rağmen, vasatın üzerine geçmek bir yana sıkıcılıktan kurtulamayan film.
hakkında bu kadar az entry girildiğini görünce sözlükte underrated kaldığına üzüldüğüm labrinth şarkısı. halbuki youtube'da 40 milyon hiti var.
sadece müziği için bile dinlenir, ne zamandır müptelası olmuş playlist'de her üç şarkıda bir buna geçiş yaparken sözlükte hakettiği ilgiyi bulamamasına da şaşıranlardanım.
itunes store'da haftanın şarkısı olarak beleşe bulunan şarkı.
şunu uzun zaman orjinali sandım http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo1vuuxeu6m
