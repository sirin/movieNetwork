she sits alone in the kitchen with her memories and photographs of all the better times she's had when she was young the days seemed short so much to do so little time but now the days just seem to pass her by so she cries she takes a pill then another, calls her mother "mother can you baby sit tonight?" the children scream her husband doesn't care so many times she's wished he wasn't there in the morning does the washing up the fish and chips the children left she scrapes away into the bin four o'clock they're home from school they scream and shout her life they rule she dreams of holidays and better things so she cries she takes a pill then another, calls her mother "mother can you baby sit tonight she wishes she was alone she could have a life of her own so she sits alone in the park she wishes she could run away but deep inside she knows she never will she dreams of living in the country with a garden full of daffodils for now a box on the window sill so she cries she takes a pill and then another, calls her mother "mother can you baby sit tonight?" she wishes she was alone she could have a life of her own she could have a life of her own a life of her own seklinde * sozlere sahip, 80li yillardan kalma oldugu soylenen *bir television personalities sarkisi.
