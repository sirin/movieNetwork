bir new model army parçası. sözleri: there's storm clouds amassing over in the west up above the moor the city shines in grey,mills closing down on the valley floor all you can do here is survive oh,grit your teeth and just stay alive and never understand. the young ones they dance with fire in their hearts till the years go by till older,defeated they stare in their beer at closing time no greater love could there ever be @song: than what i feel for you you saved my life from this.. while kings are in their counting houses people just wait here in silent rows they spat and they jeered in a last desperate fear as they watched us go oh,and now remember how we turned and ran yeah,head into the wind running hand in hand we laughed until we cried.. so many tears.. oh,so many tears...
