bir frank sinatra şarkısı. lewis allen yazmış, şöyle: what is america to me? a name, a map, or a flag i see? a certain word, "democracy"? what is america to me? the house i live in, a plot of earth, a street the grocer and the butcher, and the people that i meet the children in the playground, the faces that i see all races and religions, that's america to me the place i work in, the worker by my side the little town or city where my people lived and died the "howdy" and the handshake, the air of feeling free and the right to speak my mind out, that's america to me the things i see about me, the big things and the small the little corner newsstand and the house a mile tall the wedding in the churchyard, the laughter and the tears the dream that's been a-growin' for a hundred and fifty years the town i live in, the street, the house, the room the pavement of the city, or a garden all in bloom the church, the school, the clubhouse, the millions lights i see but especially the people that's america to me
