sarah brightman harem albumundein nigel kennedy ve kazeem el sahir ile birlikte seslendirdigi sarki. my statures are falling like feathers of snow their voices are calling in whispering word waiting for the morning light heaven is calling from rainy shores counting wounded lights falling into their dreams still searching for an open door in morning dew, a glorious scene came through, like war is over now i feel i'm coming home again the moments unfold in the meaning of love this war is over now i feel i'm coming home again an arrow of freedom is piercing my heart breaking chains of emotion given a moment to pray lost innocence to find its way feelings of sensation a cry in the dark hope is on the horizon with a reason to stay and living for a brand new day in morning dew, a glorious scene came through, like war is over now i feel i'm coming home again the moments unfold in the meaning of love this war is over now i feel i'm coming home again in morning dew, a glorious scene came through, like war is over now i feel i'm coming home again the moments unfold in the meaning of love this war is over now i feel i'm coming home again
