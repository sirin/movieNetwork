gob'un 1999 çıkışlı how far shallow takes you albumlerinden bi şarkı. sözleri de şöyle bişilerdi değişmediyse: this bridge is falling down and just like it was before, it's bad, and i made it recur. crossed the bridge and it caught my attention, an ocean, diluting frustration. so i smashed it down in search of contentment, i fell down and into the ocean but now i am wet, shivering wasted and i recognize my degeneration. i can see so clearly now that i am searching for simplicity. i can face the problem now as i look into the mirror i don't hate you. as a crutch when i am dependent, i reach out and it won't reject me. like a blanket when you need warmth it surrounds me but it still feels cold. i can face the problem now that i am searching for felicity. i can see so clearly now. when i look into your eyes i don't hate you.
