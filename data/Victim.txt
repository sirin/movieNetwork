avenged sevenfold'un 2010 çıkışlı nightmare isimli albümünün 8 no'lu şarkısı. sözleri: house full of roses a letter on the stairs a tape full of messages for anyone who cares collage of broken words and stories full of tears remembering your life 'cause we wish that you were here nothing is harder than to wake up all alone realize it's not okay it's the end of all you know time keeps passing by but it seems i'm frozen still scars are left behind but some too deep to feel and some say this can't be real and i've lost my power to feel, tonight we're all just victims of a crime when all's gone and can't be regained we can't seem to shelter the pain, inside we're all just victims of a crime some days you'll find me in the place i like to go ask questions to myself 'bout the things i'll never know what's left to find 'cause i need a little more i need a little time can we even up the score? and some say this can't be real and i've lost my power to feel, tonight we're all just victims of a crime when all's gone and can't be regained we can't seem to shelter the pain, inside we're all just victims of a crime and nothing lasts forever for all good days it's true i'd rather trade it all for somehow saving you and must have been the season that threw us out of mind once i stood so tall now i'm searching for a sign so don't need your salvation with promises and kind and all those speculation save it for another time 'cause we don't need a reason a reason just to stay some just can't be bothered to stick around another day and some say this can't be real and i've lost my power to feel, tonight we've all been victims of a crime when all is gone and can't be regained we can't seem to shelter the pain inside (oh) we've all been victims of a crime victims of a crime living with this crime i'm missing you (x4)
