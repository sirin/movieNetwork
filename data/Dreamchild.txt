(bkz: symbyosis) when everything's dark the moon changes into clouds and among the crowd i can't even find the shark the only sign i need somewhere i can stay a good place far away with blue birds to feed high on the hill, as a strawberry field a land made of dreams keep the light from the dark and the sins the bear on my knees the flowers down the trees and now i can call oh my dreamchild, take me home high on the hill, as a strawberry field a land made of dreams keep the light from the dark and the fears (bkz: noriq recher)
