ebtg temperamental'den from the top you can see so far into the distance look it's downhill all the way from here getting there is quicker like going you just slide shouldn't take more then a year i could almost like you now it's nearly over now you've shown some weaknesses now you're looking older and i heard what you said and i recognise those feelings i know how hard it is to watch you go and all the effort that it took to get here in the first place and all the effort not to let the effort show and i could almost like you now you're falling over now you're feeling hopeless now you're looking over your shoulder who's gonna come and find you? who's coming up behind you? if you can ride the backlash there's still time for a comeback you don't have to lie down and die but lazarus only did it the one time he couldn't face another try and i could almost like you now it's really over now you've shown some weakness now you're looking over your shoulder who's gonna come and find you? and who's coming up behind you?
