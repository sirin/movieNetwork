en sonunda, aşka dair cole porter aktarır: is it an earthquake or simply a shock? is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock? is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy? or is what i feel the real mccoy? is it for all time or simply a lark? is it granada i see or only asbury park? is it a fancy not worth thinking of? or is it at long last love? is it an earthquake, or simply a shock? is it the good turtle soup, or is it merely the mock? is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy? or is what i feel the real mccoy? is it for all time or simply a lark? is it granada i see or only asbury park? is it a fancy, not worth thinking of? or is it at long long long last love?
frank sinatra'nın çok güzel yorumladığı şarkı.
