samael - ceremony of opposites 'den bi şarkı. to those whom i miss, and to those who would miss me life is short, but long in the living going forth on the uncertain paths of the future seeking an outlet, a path, in vain there where that tunnel so familiar and that wall banishing the light stifling forever the hope of a better day curs'd be she who gave me birth prisoner of live, i await my deliverance i am weary of the struggle for chimeras of sensing the weight of time, past and future i began my descent as from that first day this night shall be mine, that of the great leap there will be a war, a key, a door faced with the dilemma of the cord short are the paths which lead to the tomb drunk with eternity i topple the chair beneath my feet the phobia of the infinite is speedily replaced by darkness this profound and absolute darkness which i have dreamd of for so long
