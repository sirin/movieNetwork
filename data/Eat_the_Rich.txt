(bkz: kill the rich)
motorhead'in "rock 'n' roll" albümünde yer alan harika parça: eat the rich they say music is the food of love, let's see if you are hungry enough, take a bite, take another, just like a good boy would, get a sweet thing on the side, home cooking, homicide, side order, could be your daughter, fingerlicking good come on baby, eat the rich, put the bite on the son of a bitch, don't mess around, don't give me no switch, c'mon baby eat the rich c'mon baby eat the rich sittin' here in a restaurant, tell the waiter just what you want is that the meat, you wanted to eat, how would you ever know? hash browns an' bacon strips, i love the way that you lick your lips, no fooling, i can see you drooling, feel the hunger grow eat up, eat you, eat me, eat two, get one free shetland pony, extra pepperoni just pick up the phone, eat greek, or eat chinese, eat salad, or scarf up grease you're on the shelf, maybe eat yourself, come on, bite my bone
ayni zamanda 1986da peter richardson yonetmenliginde cevrilmis, film muzigi motorheade ait, lanah pellay, nosher powell, ronald allenin oynadigi, paul mccartneynin de bir sahnesinde söyle bir gozuktugu escinselimsi zenci bir garsonun isten atilmasinin ocunu almak icin ingiltere kirsalina gidip atildigi restoranda ingiliz koyluleri ve ok yay desteginde devrim gerceklestirmesini konu alan bir filmdir ki absurd mizahin zirvelerinden biridir, israrla talep ediniz bir yerlerden.
mükemmel geçiş rifflerine sahip aerosmith şarkısı. gitar nasıl çalınmalı gibi bir soru sözkonusu olursa, aha işte böyle çalınmalıdır.
harika bir motorhead parçası lemmy de süper vocal yapıyor.

deseler ki rakınrol nedir; aha derim bu şarkıdır. motorhead olanı tabi..
benim akranlarımın, gençliklerinde (90ların başı), thrash the wall albümü ile tanışmaları muhtemel şarkı.. ne alakadır hala çözebilmiş değilim..
(bkz: tax the rich, feed the poor)
deseler ki rakınrol nedir; aha derim bu şarkıdır. aerosmith olanı tabi...
insana kendini pitbull gibi hissettiren bir rock'n'roll tarzı parça. parçada herşeyi yiyorlar lan sanki.hani bir de ezberleyebilsem yolda, durakta çemkire çemkire söyleceğim, söylerken öfke kusuyormuş izlenimi veriyor. elden gel motorhead...
