virgin steele'in "the marriage of heaven and hell - part 1" albümünde yer alan harika parça: i wake up screaming like a portrait born of hate like a lock without a key i am trapped here in this prison deliver me from me like a world within my head like a thorn in my side i am choking on your virtue what a way to die and the wind keeps on moaning shattered lightning from the skies all your promises are broken i think you just want to bury me i wake up screaming every night i wake up screaming like a guardian of lies bringing laughter in disguise i am drowning in your bullshit what a way to die like a crystal virgin mind when you blindly lead the blind i am waiting for my requiem or the end of time and the wind keeps on moaning spitting right into your eyes every bridge is burned and broken do you think you want to fuck with me i wake up screaming every night i wake up screaming ooh what to do now when i see your armour twist and crack ooh what to do now when i rip the smile right from your face rip like a portrait born of hate like a lock without a key i am trapped here, in this prison deliver me from me and the wind keeps on moaning spitting right into your eyes all your promises are broken do you think you'll stand the test of time i wake up screaming every night i wake up screaming
