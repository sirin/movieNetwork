bir jazzanova sarkisidir. vikter duplaix remixide superdir.
clara hill tarafından seslendirilmiş mükemmel ötesi jazzanova şarkısıdır. sözlerini yazmadan edemeyeceğim; something’s coming over me haven’t been the same since that evening that i put eyes on you filled me with life-changing feelings now it’s all a memory where you are is a mystery i’ll do almost anything to get back to that night i miss you wish you were here with me it felt so true but it only happened that night. only that night only that night instant chemistry something like a spiritual connection you felt it too that’s why your body came in my direction was it all a dream? since then your face i haven’t seen i’ll do almost anything to get back to that night i miss you wish that you were here with me it felt so true but it only happened that night only that night only that night why do you have to be so far away? far away wish i could be with you every day every day was it real or was i imagining things? i’d do anything, anything to get back to that night get back to that night get back to that night it only happened that night it only happened that night get back to that night get back to that night it only happened that night it only happened that night i miss you wish that you were here with me it felt so true i miss you wish that you were here with me it felt so true but it only happened that night
