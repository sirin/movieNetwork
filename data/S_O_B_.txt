bir lisa marie presley parcasi, iste sözleri: you say i seem so grim darling do you forgive me i went out on a limb cause i needed to be near the fireflies flying high above me then i hit the sky and it fell down on me you said it wasn't sharp but i cut my finger you said it just wouldn't burn and i scarred my face you know i bite my nails my skin and my fingers and i've heard that's my liver my nerves and my brain i said i just like to bite on my f**in fingers do you have another intelligent answer for me today you said it wasn't sharp but i cut my finger you said it just wouldn't burn and i scarred my face you said it just wasn't there when it fell down on me well i'm just a son of a b*tch no matter what you say i lost my trust in you you were dangerous and scary and you poisoned me with the fruits everyone was intrigued by and i finally got buried you said i won't forget and i don't remember and you said i'm something i'm not and i fell on my face you said i wouldn't rot but worms are crawling on me i'm just a son of a b*tch no matter what you say i'm just a son of a b*tch no matter what you say
