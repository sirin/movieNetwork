nocturnal rites ın 2005 de "new world messiah" den sonra beklenen albümünün ismi. aynı tempoda beklerken sanki biraz daha ağır bir albüm olmuştur ama gene de dinlemeye değerdir.ayrıca albümün en sağlam parçası delivarence olduğu kanısındayım. track list: fools never die never trust still alive something undefined our wasted days cuts like a knife end of our rope never ending one by one deliverance
august albümünden eric clapton şarkısı. sözleri: i saw you in a dream, it hit me like a bright light flashing on a screen, visions of my whole life. i used to chase the moment of desire back to when my young heart burned like a fire. it was just a, nothing but a grand illusion. heart was quicker than the eye. nothing but a grand illusion, legend in my own mind. i held you in my arms till the other side of midnight. kept you in my mind, you got me through some long nights. standing on the threshold of desire, caught between the madness and the fire. chorus it was all a grand illusion. hand was quicker than the eye. nothing but a grand illusion, legends in our own minds. i used to chase the moments of desire back to when my young heart burned like a fire. it was just a, nothing but a, it was all a grand illusion. nothing but a grand illusion. it was all a grand illusion, legend in my own mind. it was just a grand illusion. nothing but a grand illusion. it was just a grand illusion, legend in our own mind.
