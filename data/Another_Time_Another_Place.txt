engelbert humperdinck'in unutulmaz parçasıdır. tadından yenmez. sözleri de vardır tabii ki : the candles flicker in the fading light i sit alone and watch that lonely night i see you everywhere and i try desperately to hide another time, another place, i see that old familiar face and i try hard to catch your eye another road, another mile, i see that old familiar smile but you'll be with somebody new another night, another day, i'll see you standing in my way i'll stop and say, "hello, my friend" another place, another time, you'll tell me you've been doing fine and walk away from me once more i try to run away from sad regrets the bitter wine won't help me to forget that i locked up my heart and threw away the precious key another time, another place, i see that old familiar face and i try hard to catch your eye another road, another mile, i see that old familiar smile but you'll be with somebody new another night, another day, i'll see you standing in my way i'll stop and say, "hello, my friend" another place, another time, you'll tell me you've been doing fine and walk away from me once more another night, another day, i'll see you standing in my way i'll stop and say, "hello, my friend" another place, another time, you'll tell me you've been doing fine and walk away from me once more
