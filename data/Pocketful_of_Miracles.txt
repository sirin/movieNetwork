glenn ford, bette davis ve peter falk'un oynadığı 50'ler new york'unda geçen komedi. özellikle bildik peter falk ve kahya ile koparır.
11 temmuz 2006 da cnbc-e komedi filmleri kusaginda yayinlanmis ve izledigim en basarili filmler listesinde ust siralarda yer almis bir filmdir. oyunculuk ve konunun islenisi acisindan kesinlikle sikmadan kendini izletmis, eglendirmistir
frank capra'nın son yönettiği film. yine tipik bir feel good movie, ama ilahem ann margret'in ilk filmi olması ve peter falk'ın komikliğinin yanı sıra unutulmayacak güzel bir hikayesi var.
glenn ford'un uğuruna inandığı kırmızı elmalarla şekillenen güzel bir hikayeye sahip enfes film. (bkz: feel good movie)
