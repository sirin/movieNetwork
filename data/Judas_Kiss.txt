j harfiyle baslayan bi film.(bkz: nasi yaaa)
wish'in monochrome albümünden klavye agırlıklı, yavas bir parcası. it's been dark for hours now but still here i stand at the bottom of a grey wide river somewhere, nowhere, neverland and i just saw a brave new world for the first time i was born the young god is bleeding colours while he's waiting for the dawn go see the river runs wild again so wild now the damage is done please take me to the riverside someone, no one, anyone and i just live in memories, i'm the burden in your eyes it's the freedom that still brings you down but eventually it dies... don't want you to follow me whenever i may follow on 'cause i will wear my golden wings and i'll crash into the sun someone has been here before, took my heart and walked away so i can't feel i'm growing cold sometime, someday, anyday i've done time in isolation, silence is a king to me and in this kingdom only strangers remind me how i used to be don't want you to follow me whenever i may follow on 'cause i will wear my golden wings and i... i saw the sun burn... i saw the tide turn... i saw the whole world speechless, odd to me like numbness wrapped it's arms around me talking to myself i see how words will always disagree with me or was it me...?
