benny goodman orchestra'dan mükemmel bir swing parçası. sözleri pek güzeldir hemen yazalım: we meet and the angels sing the angels sing the sweetest song i've ever heard you speak and the angels sing or am i reading music into every word? suddenly the setting is strange i can see water and moonlight beaming silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore then suddenly i see it all change long winter nights with the candles gleaming through it all your face that i adore you smile and the angels sing and though it's just a gentle murmur at the start we kiss and the angels sing and leave their music ringing in my heart neşe verir öyle durduk yere.
