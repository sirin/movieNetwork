avenged sevenfold'un 2007 çıkışlı kendi ismini taşıyan albümünden vokallerini yine çok sevdiğim bir parça. sözleri: yeah, you've been alone i've been gone for far too long but with all that we've been through after all this time i'm coming home to you never let it show the pain i've grown to know 'cause with all these things we do it don't matter when i'm coming home to you i reach towards the sky i've said my goodbyes my heart's always with you now i won't question why so many have died my prayers have made it through, yeah 'cause with all these things we do it don't matter when i'm coming home to you letters keep me warm helped me through the storm but with all that we've been through after all this time i'm coming home to you i reach towards the sky, i've said my goodbyes my heart's always with you now i won't question why so many have died my prayers have made it through yeah 'cause with all these things we do it don't matter when i'm coming home to you i've always been true i've waited so long just to come hold you i'm making it through it's been far too long, we've proven our love over time's so strong, in all that we do the stars in the night, they lend me their light to bring me closer to heaven with you (bring me closer) but with all that we've been through after all this time i'm coming home to you i reach towards the sky, i've said my goodbyes my heart's always with you now i won't question why so many have died my prayers have made it through yeah 'cause with all these things we do it don't matter when i'm coming home to you and with all that we've been through after all this time i'm coming home to you
dehset bi introya sahip olan sarki.
çok şık bir avenged eseri. akustik çağrışımlarla sarstı bedenimi
özellikle sonlara doğru bulunan solosu ile birlikte bünyede çok tatlı bir the spirit carries on ve dolayısıyla dream theater hissi bırakan şarkıdır
1950'lerde ortaya çıkmıştır bu kelime. yani vahşi batıda silahşörlere gunslinger denmezdi. ihtimalle gunman denirdi.
trinity blood'daki tres iqus'ın lakabıdır.
