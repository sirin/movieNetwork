silver and gold'da yer alan bir neil young şarkısı. when the red sun sets on the railroad town, and the bars begin to laugh with a happy sound, i'll still be here right by your side, there'll not be anyone in my heart but you. and the dreams that you're having, they won't let you down, if you just follow on 'cause you know where you're bound, the well will be flowing and the words will come fast, when the one who is coming arrives here at last on the grassy hills of the railroad town, where we cut through the fences and over the crown, where wind was blowing right through your hair, i dreamt that my momma and daddy were there and the dreams that you're having, they won't let you down, if you just follow on 'cause you know where you're bound, the well will be flowing and the words will come fast, when the one who is coming arrives here at last when the red sun sets on the railroad town, and bars begin to laugh with the happy sound, i'll still be here right by your side, there'll not be another in my heart but you
