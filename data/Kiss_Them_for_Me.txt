siouxsie and the banshees'in, superstition nam albümünün ilk şarkısıdır. ironi doygunu lirikleri de şöylece, evet cicim; it glittered and it gleamed for the arriving beauty queen a ring and a car now you're the prettiest by far no party she'd not attend no invitation she wouldn't send transfixed by the inner sound of your promise to be found "nothing or no-one will ever make me let you down" kiss them for me--i may be delayed kiss them for me--if i am delayed it's divine, oh it's serene in the fountains pink champagne someone carving their devotion in the heart shaped pool of fame "nothing or no-one will ever make me let you down" kiss them for me--i may be delayed kiss them for me--i may find myself delayed on the road to new orleans a spray of stars hit the screen as the 10th impact shimmered the forbidden candles beamed kiss them for me--i may be delayed kiss them for me--i may find myself delayed kiss them for me--kiss them for me kiss them for me--i may find myself delayed

siouxsie and the bansheesin en sevdiğim onikiden vuruşu...
genç yaşta trafik kazasında ölen ve arkasında 5 öksüz çocuk bırakan güzel aktrist jayne mansfield'in anısına yazılmış mükemmel bir siouxsie and the banshees şarkısı. siouxsie: "this song was sparked off by jayne mansfield's story. she typified the dream that hollywood holds for young women - a fairytale thing." source: record hunter 12/92.
