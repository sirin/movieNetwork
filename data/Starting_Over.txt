tam adı "(just like) starting over" olan john lennon şarkısı. o halde (bkz: just like starting over)
daha yeni dinlemeye başladığım killswitch engage'in şu ana kadar dinlediğim birkaç parçası arasında en iyisi. hatta bence oldukça iyi. üstelik yeni nesil bu tarz grupları sevmememe rağmen. bu tarzlarda eksik olarak gördüğüm melodikliği ve duygusallığı, metalcore öğeleriyle gayet güzel bir potada eritmeyi başarmışlar. bir anda yavaşlamalar, durmalar; ardından mükemmel çıkışlar falan. tabii parçanın vermek istediği mesaj da hoş olmuş, anlamlı olmuş. kısacası ben sevdim killswitch engage'in bu parçasını... o kadar yazdık, sözleri de şöyle: yeah! come on! do you remember what we used to have? as if all our dreams were possible all that existed was you and i but distance has torn us apart forgive me for all that i've done wrong lead me back to where my heart belongs can we start again? go back in time to where we started can we start again? what we had can't be discarded do you remember the promises we made? but somehow we have lost our way take me back to where my heart belongs forever grateful every day i know that you doubt my words i swear there will never be regret can we start again? we thought love was everlasting can we start again? what we had just can't be wasted silent vows were broken and words that can't be taken back but you mean so much more to me than anything i've ever known and this is the hope for tomorrow that today you will return can we start again? go back in time to where we started can we start again? what we have can't be discarded can we start again? (do you remember?) can we start again? (all over) can we start again? go back in time to where we started
