motley crue'ün 1981 yılıda çıkardığı too fast for love albümünün 9. parçası. sözlerini de yazayım tam olsun frankie died just the other night some say it was suicide but we know how the story goes with his six string knife and his street wise pride the boy was a man before his time and she knew all their dreams would come true but ya see, frankie was fast too fast to know he wouldn't go slow until his lethal dose and she knows he'll finally come too close (chorus) well, on with the show going on with the show come on baby no, no, no oh my, my, my. . . . . . (repeat) he was bad he was never good but one thing that he understood and she knew all those lies would come true the time has come and he's paid his dues suzy finally got the news she always knew this day would come soon (chorus) (chorus) he was stopped on a dime with a switchblade knife some damn punk went and took frankie's life and she knew she'd have to pull through broken down, with his broken dreams with a wink of an eye said suzy, listen to me you must go on with the show go on with the show going on with the show come on baby no no no oh my my my my. . . . . . (repeat) oh baby
