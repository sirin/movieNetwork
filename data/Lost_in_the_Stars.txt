frank sinatra, elvis costello, carla bley ve martin gore gibi güzel insanların söylediği kurt weill şarkısı before lord god made the sea and the land he held all the stars in the palm of his hand and they ran through his fingers like grains of sand and one little star fall alone then the lord god hunted through the wild night air for that little dark star in the wind down there and he stated and promised he'd take special care so it wouldn't get lost again now, man don't mind if the stars grow dim and the clouds blow over and darken him so long as the lord god's watching over him keeping track how it all goes on but i've been walking through the night and the day till my eyes get weary and my hair turns grey and sometimes it seems maybe god's gone away forgetting the promise that we heard him say and we're lost out here in the stars little stars, big stars blowing through the night and we're lost out here in the stars
