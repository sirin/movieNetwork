devils and dust albümünden bir bruce springsteen şarkısı.
bir frank sinatra şarkısı. bluebirds, flowers sunshine and showers sunsets and rainbows on skies of red and blue badges, whistles rockets and missiles puppies, kittens and penny candy too you make me feel so new like carnivals and carousels popsicles and wishing wells and i am so in love with you i can't believe it's true we're gonna make it all the way home magic, potions, incense and lotions bells, books and candles can make a witches' brew but i don't need witches love spells or riches you are my treasure my fairy tale come true with you is where i'll stay all the time, anywhere turn around, and i'll be there it was i, now it's we and i know it will be just me and you, all the way home. you and me, all the way home all the way home we're home
