bir mariah carey sarkisi (bkz: butterfly)
mariah carey'in en baba, masterpiece olan şarkısı. mariahcım bu şarkıda sesini zorlayarak olağanüstü bir performans sergilemiştir. melezliğinin eseri olan hiphop aşkı ise şarkıda tavan yaparak yerini bulmuş. klibi de herhangi bir mariah klasiği gibi yine erotik tabii.. işte yağmurlu bir new york gecesi mariah zenci sevgilisinden ayrılmış, ağlıyor ve tabii yüreği onun için pıt pıt çarpıyor. sözlerini yazalım tam olsun: mmm, oh, oh (i got you stuck off the realness), oh, oh, oh (i got you stuck off the realness), yeah, it wasn't raining yet (yet), but it was definitely a little misty on that warm november night (but it was definitely), and my heart was pounding (pounding), my inner voice resounding (oh), begging me to turn away, but i just had to see your face to feel alive (to feel alive), and then you casually walked in the room (oh), and i was twisted in the web of my desire for you (and i was twisted), my apprehension blew away, i only wanted you to taste my sadness as you kissed me in the dark (oh), every time i feel the need, i envision you caressing me, and go back in time, to relive the splendor of you and i, on the rooftop that rainy night, and so we finished the moët and started feeling liberated, and i surrendered as you took me in your arms (you took me in your arms), i was so caught up in the moment, i couldn't bear to let you go yet, so i threw caution to the wind and started listening to my longing heart (so i), and then you softly pressed your lips to mine (oh), and feelings surfaced i'd suppressed for such a long, long time (and i was lifted), and for a while i forgot the sorrow and the pain (oh), and melted with you as we stood there in the rain, every time i feel the need, i envision you caressing me (envision you caressing me), and go back in time (back), to relive the splendor of you and i (you and i), on the rooftop that rainy night, every time i feel the need (every time), i envision you caressing me (envision you), and go back in time, to relive the splendor of you and i (you), on the rooftop that rainy night, last night i dreamed that i whispered the words i love you, and touched you so very subtly as we were kissing goodbye, oh, oh yeah, yeah, oh, pretty baby, how i'm missing you, every time, every time i feel the need, i envision you caressing me (envision you caressing me), and go back in time (i go back), to relive the splendor of you and i (oh), on the rooftop that rainy night (on the roof that rainy night), every time i feel the need (when i feel the need), i envision you caressing me (i envision you over and over and over again), and go back in time (oh), to relive the splendor of you and i (it was oh so sweet you and i), on the rooftop that rainy night (on that rainy night), every time i feel the need (last night i had the strangest dream), i envision you caressing me (it was actually quite symbolic), and go back in time (as i whispered), to relive the splendor of you and i (that i loved you very subtly), every time i feel the need, i envision you caressing me, and go back in time, to relive the splendor of you and i, on the rooftop that rainy night.
