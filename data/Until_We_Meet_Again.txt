the myriad'ın süper bir şarkısı. sözlerine gelecek olursak : slip away with me close your eyes, you're free dreams are often lost but heaven's not far off and i've given all i have and i've given my whole soul and i'm ready to go... one last kiss tonight when the time feels right take my hand, and see the angels round you and me and i've given all i have and i've given my whole soul and i'm ready to go... (i'm ready, i'm ready, i'm ready to go...) (i'm ready, i'm ready, i'm ready to go...) one last kiss tonight when the time feels right take my hand, and see the angels round you and me and i've given all i have and i've given my whole soul and i'm ready to go...
