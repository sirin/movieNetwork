filme adını veren loretta lynn şarkısı. well, i was born a coal miner's daughter in a cabin on a hill in butcher holler we were poor but we had love that's the one thing my daddy made sure of he shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar my daddy worked all night in the van lear coal mine all day long in the field hoeing corn mama rocked the baby at night read the bible by a coal oil light and everything would start all over come break of morn daddy loved and raised eight kids on a coal miner's pay mama scrubbed our clothes on a washboard every day i've seen her fingers bleed to complain there was no need she'd smile in mama's understanding way in the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear but in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair from a mail-order catalogue, money made by selling a hog daddy always seemed to get the money somewhere i'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter i remember well, the well where i drew water the work we done was hard at night we'd sleep, cause we were tired i never thought i'd ever leave butcher holler well a lot of things have changed, since way back when and it's so good to be back home again not much left but the floor nothing lives here anymore just a memory of a coal miner's daughter
yağmurlu bir pazar sabahı kalktığınızda tesadüfen radyodan duyarsanız sizi teknolojinin henüz varolmadığı o eski zamanlara götürüp yarattığı 60larin amerikası hissiyle yüzünüze güzel bir gülümseme yerleştirecek olan şarkıdır.
