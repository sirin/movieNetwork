bir siouxsie and the banshees şarkısı. peepshow albümünden. sözleri de şöyle: down where this ugly man seeks his sustenance down in the blue, midnight flare a glass hand cuts through the water scything into his twisted roots then from his eyes spring fireflies breathing life into a roaring disguise needles and sins, sins and needles he's gasping for air in the wishing well dust to rust, ashes on gashes hand around the killing jar hand around the killing jar a soft hoodwink of shadows the size of make-believe punching through his spike of rage a glass hand cuts through the water snuffing out the magic fury then from inside bolt lightning cries swiftly crushed the final, muffled sighs needles and sins, sins and needles he's gasping for air in the wishing well dust to rust, ashes on gashes hand around the killing jar hand around the killing jar
