bağımlılık yapan mükemmel arch enemy şarkısı. bir süre sonra johan liiva'nin sesi yankılanmaya başlar kulaklarınızda...
herşey mükemmel bu şarkıda, ama "a day will come when the sun will rise again, rays of black will shine and together as one we will walk in the dark of the sun" deyişi yok mu johan liiva'nın, sesini sevmesem de kurban olurum o kısma be. çok çok güzel.
sözlerini de yazalım, tam olsun: like insects of the night, we are drawn into the light feeding off the starglow energy - controlling our fate bloodsucker selling hope to the hopeless newborn messiah or the devil incarnate? surrounded by a field of lost souls these feeble minds - so easy to control salvation damnation it's all the same to you but does anyone really know what the future holds in store a day will come when the sun will rise again rays of black will shine and together as one, we will walk in the dark of the sun say a prayer for the unborn child in the womb the children are the heirs of this dogmatic chaos is there a future in this claustrophobic tomb? we can only rely upon ourselves, to save us we are the resistance, our last line of defense prepared to fight for our promised land rebels at heart, they will hunt us to the ends of the earth the chase is on - forever going on and on
