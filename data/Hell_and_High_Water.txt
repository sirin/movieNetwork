sözleri aşağıdaki gibi olan bir black stone cherry şarkısı. i know your hiding places and i know your every move 'cuz girl, i've been lonely too and i seen a million faces been to a million places but girl, there's no one quite like you and i've gone through hell & high water washed away with the tide i can lose a damn war all by myself if you were on the other side so in the morning when the rooster crows pack your bags and get ready to go if you're walking through hell & high water please don't do it alone and i know, you feel let down and i know, you've been turned out i wish i'd been there for you so when the night time comes around and you feel like an only child just know, i'll be there for you and i've gone through hell & high water washed away with the tide i can lose a damn war all by myself if you were on the other side so in the morning when the rooster crows pack your bags and get ready to go if you're walking through hell & high water please don't do it alone and i've gone through hell & high water washed away with the tide i can lose a damn war all by myself if you were on the other side
