avustralya illerinden 60'ların popüler grubu seekersın çevirdikleri filmde yer alan bu parçanın sözleri jim dale ; müziği tom springfield e aitmiş efenim. sözlerini yazmasam eksik olurdu: hey there! -georgy girl- swinging down the street so fancy free, nobody you meet could ever see the loneliness there inside you hey there! -georgy girl- why do all the boys just pass you by? couldt it be you just dont try, or is the clothes you wear? you are always window shopping but never stopping to buy. so shed those dowdy feathers and fly a little bit. hey there! -georgy girl- there's another georgy deep inside bring out all the love you hide and oh, what a change ther'd be the world would see a new georgy girl dreaming of the someone you could be. life is a reality, you can't always run away. don't be so scared of changing and rearranging yourself. it's time for jumping down from the shelf a little bit.
