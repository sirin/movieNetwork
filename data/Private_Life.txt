güzel bir the pretenders şarkısı. your private life drama baby leave me out (repeat 3 times) j'ai les glands with your theatrics your acting's a drag it's ok on tv 'cause you can turn it off but don't try me yes your marriage is a tragedy but it's not my concern i'm very superficial i hate anything official (chorus) your private life drama baby leave me out (repeat 3 times) (backup chorus) you've been lying to someone and now me stop (repeat 3 times) your sentimental gestures only bore me to death you've made a desperate appeal now save your breath attachment to obligation through guilt and regret shit that's so wet and your sex life complications are not my fascinations (chorus) you asked me for advice i said use the door but you're still clinging to somebody you deplore and now you wanna use me for emotional blackmail i just feel pity when you lie, contempt when you cry (chorus)
