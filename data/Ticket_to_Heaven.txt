mark knopfler'ın bir şarkıyı ne kadar içten söylediğinin en büyük kanıtı olan aşmış duygu seli.nitekim sözlerin anlatmak istediği duyguları sözlerde bırakmayıp sesiyle de bize hissettirebilen bir yorumda bulunmuştur bu şarkıda knopfler.
dünyanın en huzur veren şarkısı. ustalık işi. moralin bozuksa aç dinle, kendini şarj et. tamamsın.
