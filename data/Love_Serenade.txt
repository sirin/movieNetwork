barry white in 1975 tarihli albumu ve bu albumun parcalarindan biri. harika uzun bir ritmi var, merhum barry sevismek icin yazmis olsa gerek.
barry bunu sevişmek için yazmamış; barry bunu sevişirken yazmıştır. yine konuşurcasına söylediği bu şarkının gitgide erotizme bağlayan libido yükselten sözleri mevcut, hell yeah: take it off baby, take it all off i wanna see you the way you came into the world i dont wanna feel no clothes i dont wanna see no panties and take off that brassiere, my dear everybody's gone i'm taking the receiver off the phone because baby you and me... this night.... we're gonna get it on to love serenade.... you know i get in these moods... well you know how it is and i'm very glad to know that you feel the same way too baby we're gonna lay here...and we're gonna make love and we're gonna do it like its supposed to be done heaven only knows what goes on behind closed doors the very depths of our souls will reach out tonight you and me baby in love...serenade make me want you tempt me, tempt me, tempt me make me need you let me long for you you'll know what its like when a man and woman become one and the only real way you can do that baby is when we're makin' love to each other when you reach that that simple feeling when you're makin love it's.. it's like you're in another world help me... help me... oh baby help me lord have mercy on me.
