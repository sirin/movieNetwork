"bu adamlar çok funky dostum!" dememe neden olmuş şarkı. ayrıca öyle müstehcen ve tatlı bir şarkı ki. shakespeare'in "will" kelimesini farklı anlamlarda aynı anda kullanarak*** yarattığı etkiyi teacup** ile yaratmış gençler. bravo beh.
ayrıca sözlerdeki "your walkin' like a sour kraut" daha çok "you're fuckin like a sauerkraut" gibi duyulmaktadır. (bkz: kulağımın yalancısıyım)
