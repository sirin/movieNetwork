en güzelinden bir shanty. sözleri de şu şekildedir: my name is captain kidd as i sailed, as i sailed, oh my name is captain kidd as i sailed, my name is captain kidd and god's laws i did forbid, and most wickedly i did as i sailed. my father taught me well to shun the gates of hell, but against him i rebelled as i sailed, he shoved a bible in my hand but i left it in the sand and i pulled away from land, as i sailed [chorus] i murdered william moore and i left him in his gore twenty leagues away from shore as i sailed, and being crueler still, the gunner i did kill all his precious blood did spill, as i sailed, [chorus] i was sick and nigh to death, and i vowed at every breath, oh to walk in wisdom's path, as i sailed but my repentance lasted not, my vows i soon forgot, oh damnation is my lot, as i sailed. [chorus] to the execution dock lay my head upon the block, laws no more i'll mock as i sail, so take warning here and heed to shun bad company or you'll wind up just like me as i sailed.
