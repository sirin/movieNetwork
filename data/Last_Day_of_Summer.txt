the sız last day of summer'dır. magnet isimli grubun seslendirdiği bu şarkı en az the cure 'ın the 'lı şarkısı kadar dokunaklı ve dinlenmeyi hakediyor. you crash out on his side all is quiet, all is calm the air thick with stale smoke, your cheap perfume and alcohol and although you know you need him like a stake through your heart you think it's worse to stay apart cause it's the last day of summer, and it will hurt you more than most cause you're still trying to mine for memories in a ghost yeah, it's the last day of summer and you know you're not supposed, but you're still trying to mine for memories in a ghost you're absence makes no sense, just a constant state of suspense and although you both know the bubble might burst as soon as you meet another false start, rather than to stay apart cause it's the last day of summer, and it will hurt you more than most cause you're still trying to mine for memories in a ghost yeah, it's the last day of summer and you know you're not supposed, but you're still trying to mine for memories in a ghost it's the last day of summer and you know you're not supposed you're still trying to mine for memories in a ghost it's the last day of summer it's the last day of summer it's the last day of summer
