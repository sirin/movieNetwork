richard harris şarkısı. zeki müren türkçeye çevirip söylemiş arabeske kaçarak.hüzünlü bir şarkı..
elvis presley'in seslendirdigi, aranjmanini da seni hayatimca sevdim ismiyle tanju okan'dan dinledigimiz sarki. bi' "bukle"cik sozlerini de yazayim tam olsun: "you're sleeping son, i know but, really, this can't wait i wanted to explain before it just too late for your mother and me love has finally died this is no happy home but god knows how i've tried because you're all i have, my boy you are my life, my pride, my joy and if i stay, i stay because of you, my boy i know it's hard to understand why did we ever start? we're more like strangers now each acting out a part i have laughed, i have cried i have lost every game taken all i can take but i'll stay here just the same *sleep on, you haven't heard a word perhaps it's just as well why spoil your little dreams why put you through the hell life is no fairytale as one day you will know but now you're just a child i'll stay here and watch you grow"
her ne kadar “oglum”* dese de, ‘ayrik’ bir baba kiz iliskisinde, muhtemel $anssizliklari film seridi tadinda tekrar ya$atan; bir baba ictenligi ile hesapsizca duyulmasi ozlenen sozleri* animsatip, insanin icine oturan bir sarkidir.
elvis cok kötü söylemistir bu sarkiyi, richard harris cok daha güzel söyler. yoksa elvis gene de kraldir. zeki müren ise resmen batirmis, arabeske bulamis.
richard harris'in 1972 yılında listebaşı olmuş şarkısı.ünlü aktör şarkıcılıkta da başarılıdır.

cemiyette pişiyorum'un 2003 yılında yayınladığı hayatta herkesi anlatan bir resim vardır'ından; my boy's mad at me i didn't wanna see the film tonight i found it hard to say he thought i'd had enough of him why can't he see he's lovely to me? but i like to stay in and watch t.v. on my own every now and then my boy's mad at me been on the telephone for an hour we hardly said a word i tried and tried but i could not be heard why can't i explain? why do i feel this pain? 'cause everything i say he doesn't understand he doesn't realise he takes it all the wrong way *

elvis presley oğluna yazsa da ben her dinlediğimde o anda uyuyan sevdiğime göndermekteyim şarkıyı. kendisi bundan habersiz uyumaya devam ederken, şarkıyı dinlemek ayrı bir haz veriyor insana.
android isletim sistemini kullanan cep telefonu ve tabletler icin gameboy emulatoru uygulamasi. bu uygulamayi kullanarak pokemon firered gibi eski gameboy oyunlarini gayet guzel bir sekilde telefonunuzda oynayabilirsiniz. yalniz ucretsiz versiyonunda oyunu kaydetme ozelligi bulunmuyor. tam surumu ise birkac hafta once ben aldigimda $4.99 idi. pokemon severlere tavsiye ederim.
android için gameboy advance emülatörüdür. tabi ben pokemon oyunlarımı nintendo dsi'da oynuyorum. güzel kızlara selam ederim.
