u2 nun bir kac konserinde caldigi, henuz bir albumunde yayinlanmamis olan cok guzel bir parcasi: fourty-five lightyears from home is where you are and where i want to be beside you looking for directions stars are your reflection to the space between you and me i, i can’t wait any longer for your love i can’t wait, i can’t wait i can’t wait any longer for it i can’t wait any longer for your love to visit me they’re still singing for there when they fly above the covenant it’s not a song of discontent i’ve money now it’s me that’s spent here i am, a space cowboy looking out for love and logic in the universe, yeah, yeah i can’t wait any longer for your love i can’t wait, i can’t wait i can’t wait any longer for it i can’t wait any longer for your love to visit me and the day packs it in and you watch as the sun goes down pray that the night will come quickly you hope, you pray that those clouds leave the sky alone ‘cause there’s only one light that can guide you guide you home, home say it, say it, say it, say it i can’t wait any longer i can’t wait any longer for your love i can’t wait any longer for your love i can’t wait, i can’t wait i can’t wait for your love for your love it’s like the circles in the song well, the lights have been shining you want it, you got it you take a lot of loving inside http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os1jahs4eeg
