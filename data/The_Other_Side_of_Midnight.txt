crimson glory'nin "astronomica" albümünde yer alan harika parça: the other side of midnight midnight tolls on the clock downstairs a reminding voice inside my head that does not care his rapture keeps me waiting for a life behind the attic door footsteps on the stairs...no one there... i watch my shadow fade to gray from the warmth of daylights charm i cower, turn and run away from a light so bright and warm with my fading health i start to cry and cut myself to watch the blood look silver in the blessing of the moon... i sit here in my rocking chair they've come again to tie me down and wash my hair faceless figures on the wall haunt me 'til the morning dawn behind the attic door why can't they let me go? here where devil's roam twisted and bleeding all alone in this hell beyond the light on the other side of midnight... the other side of midnight!! i bang my head against the wall to kill the demons in my soul i blind myself so i can't see evil things inside of me... you're not me? who's there? am i evil?

ailecek "ne güzel bir film" diyerek seyredilirken pat diye çıkan bildiğin hardcore çırılçıplak sevişme sahneleri yüzünden insanı odadan koşarak kaçmaya meylettiren film. hakkaten seyretmeye değer ama gidip dvd'sini almaya değmez. imdb notu 5.6'dır. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076507/
