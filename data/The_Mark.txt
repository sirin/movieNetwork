gaz bir black light burns parçası. wes borland harikalarından.. i have a mark on me like a brand on my skin that only i can see i don't know what it means, i get caught up in dreams i feel like running away, yeah so let's run away sometimes you gonna have to get lost if you're ever gonna find your way back to where you came from and if we go there they'll just want us to bleed yah but it's never enough it's never enough it's never enough so cut out the heart and watch the world burn down let's tear it apart let's leave a mark let's leave a mark i followed the footprints around in the snow i ended up doing circles and came back home where i started to find that everyone was a sign and all that mattered was that this fucking fire is mine sometimes you gonna have to die if you're ever gonna find your way back to where your life is if hate is a fist and love is a flame i'm gonna smash it and burn it 'cause it's all the same so cut out the heart and watch the world burn down let's tear it apart let's leave a mark let's leave a mark it keeps bleeding and bleeding it's never enough, it's a lush, it combusts and it continues to swell and i've tried, yes i've tried to ignore this scar but it keeps burning in me and it won't let me breathe so cut out the heart and watch the world burn down let's tear it apart let's leave a mark let's leave a mark
