bir brandi carlile sarkisi: gone, it's hard for me to say when i'm wrong it's hard for me to weep when i'm strong but i can never sleep when you're gone oh, but still, if you are gonna crucify me i wouldn't want nobody to see 'cause you could kick me hard when i'm down down, down, down i don't want to be nobody's fool i've played that part so many times before how i long to be a shadow on the wall i will make no sound at all and when the sun goes down the shadow on the wall cannot be seen at all at all oh friend, it's not that you would mess with my head i believe that you believe what you said you think you know me best and you care but that's not fair 'cause i don't really want to be seen it must've been the way i was raised to sleep with one eye open i'd say hey, hey, hey chorus oh how i long to be a shadow on the wall i will make no sound at all at all
