the delgados un peloton albümünün 3. şarkısı. sözleri: this is not my house but i know you both so well feels like it could be but i can hear the bell days with his soulmate clothing for a course dines on a cloth plate he wonders if she scores why did you buy this? i know you dressed in red hardly surprising the bed before you wed if i forget what i saw this time i'll find you see the sign on a wall pray it won't kill you book a room, book it soon before i find you move aside as i slide move into those you know best it looks so real but i think it's just too tall let me try it i'll stand here in the hall and i know that ice can't burn but i can see the flames melting the blocks in turn before i name some names if i forget what i saw this time i'll find you see the sign on the wall pray it won't kill you book a room, book it soon before i find you move aside as i slide move into those you love best mind the style, i'm relaxing for a while taking stock of the job you have in hand you will find what's behind all the actions of this kind be it all that they're happening in your head there's this guy who speaks and i know he knows i'm weak find possessions by myself, i can't carry them i'm ... all before i go there's some gratitude to show for the car, hear me out, was a star these lights they are hurting and these games of names of old don't go confusing the console with the board now i see a train station the name i see is brain show me the exit now so i can get away if i forget what i saw this time i'll find you see the sign on a wall pray it won't kill you book a room, book it soon before i find you move aside as i slide move into those you know best. şeklindedir.
