contagion albümünden şahane bir arena parçası.bir de akustik versiyonu vardır ki orjinali kadar fena. (bkz: hemen sozlerini de yazayım) knowing what i know i'm never free to come and go but when i try to open doors i burn when daylight hits the floor playing the skin game breathing the blue flame playing the skin game in sight, insane knowing what i know i've been looking for a space to grow and maybe i can set you free yes maybe i can set you free playing the skin game breathing the blue flame playing the skin game in sight, insane i'm content to live in the vacuum i have made a comfortable existence on my own the problems of the world are there for others to debate i prefer to face my days alone! kneeling down before i sleep never said a prayer that i believed one day you'll understand why have i become this way? maybe it's another quirk of fate yielding to my dna try to live on my own reborn once more as a whisper on the telephone unafraid of it all every thought, every dream, i will call! i will call! now i'm living alone and all i am is a whisper on the telephone making sense of it all every thought, every dream, i will call! i will call!
