gorunmez uzaylilar bi minik saucerla dunyaya gelirler. eh dunyamizin da bi kahramana ihtiyaci vardir. olaylar gelisir
queensrychein boktan albumundeki boktan $arkisi.(bkz: q2k)
kyffhäuserstraße 43 koln adresinde, pzt.-pers. 19:00~01:00, cum.-cts. 19:00~04:00, paz. 15:00~01:00 saatleri arasi acik, her aksam dj performansi dinleyebileceginiz underground mekan. tam karsisinda bulunan oruc kebap'ta, suppper lahmacun arasi döner + salata 2,50 euro.
az bulunur kategorisindeki soundtracki gerçekten acayiptir. cinema of transgression filmlerinin ve tüm 80'ler underground'ından izler taşıyan, garip bir 80'ler fantezisine fon müziği yapar.
q2k albümündeki bir queensryche şarkısı. i ain't no romeo. i'm just the man for you. holding out as secrets travel, they kind of get to you. everybody says that it could've been something. never was a smart kid, never knew a good thing. always hearing voices swim ... in your liquid sky. liquid sky ... always hearing voices, like no more choices in disguise. i ain't no sacred idol or a saint pretending. i'll build you up. i'll tear you down. turn you wrong side in. what am i afraid of? everyone's listening. standing on my soapbox, lost the beginning. always hearing voices ... swim ... in your liquid sky. liquid sky ... i'm always hearing voices, like no more choices, like a lie. it's just, it's just liquid sky. i'm always hearing voices like electric shock waves in disguise. i don't know what this means. i'll leave it for your interpretation. it's just me at the edge ... everybody says that it could have been something. never was a smart kid, never knew a good thing. always hearing voices ... swim in your liquid sky. liquid sky ... i'm always hearing voices, like no more choices, like a lie. it's just, it's just liquid sky. i'm always hearing voices like electric shock waves in disguise. always hearing voices swim ...
