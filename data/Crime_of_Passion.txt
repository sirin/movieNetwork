(bkz: crimes of passion)
bir mike oldfield şarkısı. sözlerini de yazayım tam olsun: on a bright day she passed away in the morning it's a cruel way to take her away with no warning he took her hand through every midnight hour and then he saw her fading away like a spring shower i can see a complete life's time pictures and posters of times and fashion nineteen years with no reason or rhyme taken away in a crime of passion he stood to see if he could catch her breathing but i was no good he understood she was leaving he looked outside the frosty window pane and then he saw her moving away elizabeth jane chorus i see freedom in sight it's a long climb but she would not give up the fight for a long time and i see a light come shining into night baby it's all right we couldn't have changed it was second sight chorus i see freedom light shining in the night i see freedom but she wouldn't give up the fight i see her light come shining into night baby it's all right we couldn't have changed it was second sight i see a light come shining into night baby it's all right we couldn't have changed it was second sight http://youtube.com/watch?v=qfrzkd2d8le
