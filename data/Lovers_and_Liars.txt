matchbook romance şarkısı. let's start out by starting over. what did i expect? you're no good at lying and i'm no good at comebacks. but you're so untouchable. i'm oh-so-terrible at this. i'm terrible at this, you know. don't hold this against me. i've already said i'm sorry. and i bet you've got every word i said memorized in your head. and you'll use every one of them, and you'll use every one of them against me. don't hold this against me. i've already said i'm sorry. (tell all your friends about me) don't hold this against me. i've already said i'm sorry. i hope you choke on every word you spoke when you were screaming at me. and realize how many times i've tried, but that's wishful thinking. all i want is an apology for what you did and how you treated me. get me far away, or at least as far as this car will take me.
