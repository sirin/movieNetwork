yanninin oldukça sessiz parçası
duygulu bir anda arka plana en çok uyan, sakin, kendi halinde ilerleyen pek bir güzel parça..
parça in my time albümündedir.
(bkz: alone in the dark)
muhteşem bir klip çekilmiş skillet parçası.şimdilik pek bilen yok ancak bu grubun patlaması yakındır.patlamada muhtemelen bu parçayla gelecek.işte o çok beklediğiniz sözleri: despite the lies that you're making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses despite the lies that you're making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses i will be the one that's gonna hold you i will be the one that you run to my love is a burning, consuming fire no, you'll never be alone when darkness comes i'll light the night with stars hear the whispers in the dark no, you'll never be alone when darkness comes you know i'm never far hear the whispers in the dark whispers in the dark you feel so lonely and ragged you lay there broken and naked my love is just waiting to clothe you in crimson roses i will be the one that's gonna find you i will be the one that's gonna guide you my love is a burning, consuming fire no, you'll never be alone when darkness comes i'll light the night with stars hear the whispers in the dark no, you'll never be alone when darkness comes you know i'm never far hear the whispers in the dark no, you'll never be alone when darkness comes i'll light the night with stars hear the whispers in the dark no, you'll never be alone when darkness comes you know i'm never far hear the whispers in the dark whispers in the dark whispers in the dark whispers in the dark
udo'nun dominator albümünden ağır bir şarkı. önlerinde saygıyla eğiliyorum. the silent times – they are the worst so still and unforgiving you’re all alone – you fear the words the end and the beginning they’re calling you – they call your name and then you’ve got to answer is nowhere safe – no way to hide beware the devil’s chancer inside the spark of pestilence is hiding in us all and when you hear the evil words you’re ready to be called here they come – have their fun – twisting minds whispers in the dark so beware – just take care whispers in the dark a look that kills – a breath that hates takes over on the inside a game that thrills – the open gate to hell and back – a joyride a visit to the underworld an easy way to fool you and when you don’t know where to go a wrong turn and they’ll doom you
mumford & sons grubunun ikinci albümü olan babel'den bir parça.
