(bkz: trembling blue stars) if i knew you didn't miss me, if i knew you didn't think of me, if i knew your feelings for me were dead and buried, it would be hard, but not as hard as this knowing you still care - it would be easier than knowing there's still something there. i know how you don't need this but i just can't keep quiet. you've left me feeling so lost, where do i go with it? i know you have a new life, i know you're not unhappy, i know that he's good to you - but don't you just want things easy? so go ahead and hate me, i know i promised i would leave it - a troublemaker's what you've made me but can't you see we're worth it? we just belong together, i think somewhere inside you know it. would you admit it ever? i just don't think it's complicated. life shouldn't be about: "i'm happy, but..." i just think you should chase specialness for love. i guess all i'm really saying is how i think you're wrong here, and some things are worth the chaos that they come along with. don't you want more? don't you want to burn? burn again?
