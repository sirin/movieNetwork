the violet hour'dan the clientele sarkisi. (bkz: missing) midnight coming back around the summer heat that wears me out is rising through a firmament of cranes and the friends i've left behind are speechless in my sunlit mind as through the door to summer through the door to summer they pass away if there's a stillness in your eyes the unreal city's closing all its summer doors on you tonight yeah won't you step into the light the arcades that have blossomed just to fade into the shadows of the night through all the trains still moving in my mind the gas fire flares into the light and i am in this house on fire but i was only watching clouds go by as through the door to summer through the door to summer we pass away and we were old before our time and we knew as we heard the fields just singing in the quiet yeah that one day the band would strike a tune that carried us along through city gardens, leaving in the heat and all the deals and trials on ganton street the gas fire flares into the light and i am in this house on fire but i was only watching clouds go by i picked her up at half past four the church hall in a haze unreal as i could ever really be and everyone was leaving and the moment passed away and ended up inside my heart a dream midnight coming back around the summer heat that wears me out is rising to my eyes behind the flames i have come to disbelieve exactly what i hear and see as through the door to summer through the door to summer we pass away
