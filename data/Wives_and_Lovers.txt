bir çok cazcı tarafından yorumlanmış güzel mi güzel bir burt bacharach - hal david ikilisi eseri. hele ella fitzgerald yorumu pek bir lezizdir. hey, little girl, comb your hair, fix your make-up. soon he will open the door. don't think because there's a ring on your finger, you needn't try any more for wives should always be lovers, too. run to his arms the moment he comes home to you. i'm warning you. day after day, there are girls at the office, and men will always be men. don't send him off with your hair still in curlers. you may not see him again. for wives should always be lovers, too. run to his arms the moment he comes home to you. he's almost here. hey, little girl better wear something pretty, something you'd wear to go to the city. and dim all the lights, pour the wine, start the music. time to get ready for love. oh, time to get ready, time to get ready, time to get ready for love.
jack jones tarafından da çok güzel bir şekilde yorumlanmış olan şarkı.
julie london'dan daha güzel yorumlayabilen olmamıştır, olamayacaktır.
