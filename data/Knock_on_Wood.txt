hayatımda duyduğum en eğlenceli şarkılardan biri, casablanca filminde dooley wilson tarafından seslendiriliyor. sözleri: say, who’s got trouble? we got trouble. how much trouble? too much trouble well now don’t you frown. just knuckle down and knock on wood (knock knock knock on tables) who’s unhappy? we’re unhappy how unhappy? too unhappy oh! oh! that won’t do when you are blue just knock on wood (knock knock knock on tables) who’s unlucky? we’re unlucky how unlucky? too unlucky but your luck will change if you’ll arrange to knock on wood (knock knock knock on tables) who’s got nothing? we got nothing how much nothing? too much nothing say nothing’s not a awful lot but knock on wood (knock knock knock on tables) now who’s happy? we’re all happy just how happy? very happy that’s the way were going to stay so knock on wood (knock knock knock on tables) now who’s lucky? we’re all lucky just how lucky? very lucky well smile again and once again lets knock on wood (knock knock knock on tables)
