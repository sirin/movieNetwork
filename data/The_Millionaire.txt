içten ve eğlenceli bir dr hook şarkısı. sözleri için copy&paste arkadaşımıza başvuruyoruz : i'm not a bad person, i don't drink, and i don't kill. i got no evil habits, and i probably never will. i don't sing like elvis presley, i can't dance like fred astaire. but there's one thing in my favor, i'm a millionaire! chorus: and i got more money, than a horse has hairs. cause my rich old uncle died, and answered all my prayers! having all this money, is going to bring me down. if you ain't with me honey, to help me spread it around! i could get myself a nose job, i could diet for a year. but i'll never be robert redford, cause i'm much to fond of beer. please don't misunderstand me, it's not love i'm trying to buy. it's just i got all this here money, and i'm a pretty ugly guy. chorus i don't mind if you love me for my money, if you love me for whatever else i got. but 'cept for all this stuff, i'm a lonely fort knox, i don't guess i'm doing all that hot. chorus money, money, money, money................
