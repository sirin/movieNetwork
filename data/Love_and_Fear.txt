sözlerini de yazayım tam olsun love and fear there’s a tale that says that life is simple when love is all around some say that the pain of being alive is the pain of love and it’ll make you fly above the highest mountain but can make you dive into the sea of tears i believe that there are two sides of the story it’s all about you, all about me, all about… love and fear like brother and sister they’re keeping together till the end of days love and fear no light without darkness no cure without pain no sun without rain any love, someday, will melt into a phase of insecurity and when affection is drifting you’ll find out if true love was ever there love will always be there to cover lovers it’ll help you through the lowest vale don’t you think that there are two sides of the story it’s all about you, all about me, all about… love and fear … nothing worse than a broken heart evil fear makes it fall apart but you got to have faith and see the brightness of the days love and fear …
