dinlediğim en güzel özlem şarkılarından biri olan greg laswell güzelliği.hele 02:20'den itibaren içini çekerek öyle bir '' i......miss you '' deyişi vardır ki,boğazınızdaki yumruyu çözer ve gözlerinizdeki barajları kaldırır. i'm going to see some friends from out of state the very trip that you were supposed to take a while ago but it fell through like all of you like all of you thought i'd make the drive but a free plane ride is in the air and just like that my fear of it disappeared like all of you like all of you and i look high and low for yesterday high and low for you and i high and low once i can see straight i might move somewhere cold seattle or the bay area; to see your ghost what's left of you what's left of you and i look high and low for yesterday high and low for you and i high and low found a letter from a man i might have met,addressed to you and i'll steal the words he ended with: i miss you and i do miss you and i do high and low for yesterday high and low for you and i high and low
