wasp ın 2001 yılı albümü still not black enough tan blackie lawless ın sarkastik tarzından vazgeçip eleştirel tavrını net bir şekilde ortaya koyduğu wasp diskografisinde çok önemli bir parça. i'm politically incorrect and damn proud of it i love my country but i'm scared to death of its government ya believe what you read cause it's all that we give ya cause all of history is written by winners i'm engaged in a frenzy of mass self-destruction i feed upon your famine to fuel my corruption i'm wholeselling hatred and international incest to carnivorous hyenas in a global theft fest i've mastered the arts of death and foreign nations genocide and those who turn on me commit national suicide
still not black enough'ta öne çıkan, albümü taşıyabilecek güzellikte şarkı. lawless şimdiye kadar politik duruş bakımından istikrarsız bir çizgi izlese de şarkı güzeldir. i'm politically incorrect and damn proud of it i love my country but i'm scared to death of its government ya believe what you read cause it's all that we give ya cause all of history is written by winners i'm engaged in a frenzy of mass self-destruction i feed upon your famine to fuel my corruption i'm wholeselling hatred and international incest to carnivorous hyenas in a global theft fest i've mastered the arts of death and foreign nations genocide and those who turn on me commit national suicide i'm the queen of the global dream and i rule a declining nation i sit and watch all the violent screams from the throne of your desperation i killed them all and stole their land enslaved the blacks and slaughtered the red man in god we trusted and i gave birth to would be kings to rule the earth i have more pigs than i have tits to feed i embrace the world's phoney leaders and hold the sucklings to my breast and i'd fool you all as i'd feed ya i'll prop you up then strike you down and lick your blood up form your ground humpty fuckin dumpty my empire's falling down breakdown, goodbye america so long the music's died freedom's last hero's wasted i made you, i'll break you breakdown, goodbye america it's all gone, kiss it goodbye there on bloody bended knees where my nation died
