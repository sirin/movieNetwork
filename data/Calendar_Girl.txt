set yourself on fire'in kapanis sarkisi. (bkz: stars) amme hizmeti olarak sozleri de asagidadir. if i am lost for a day try to find me, but if i don't come back then i won't look behind me. all of the things i thought were so easy just got harder and harder each day december is darkest, and june is the light. but this empty bedroom won't make anything right. and out on the landing a friend i forgot to send home who waits up for me all through the night. calendar girl, whos in love with the world stay alive i dreamed i was dying as i so often do; and when i awoke i was sure it was true. i ran to the window threw my head to the sky, and said whoever is up there, please don't let me die i can't live forever. i can't always be. one day i'll be sand on the beach by the sea; the pages keep turning, i'll mark off each day with a cross and i'll laugh about all that we've lost. calendar girl, who is lost to the world stay alive january febuary march april may, i'm alive june july august september october, i'm alive november december, yeah all through the winter i'm alive...
