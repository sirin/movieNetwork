1961 yılında kaydedilmiş bir frank sinatra şarkısı. as you desire me, so shall i come to you, howe'er you wander, so shall i be, be it forever, or be it just a day, as you desire me, come what may. i doubt not but you will do what you will with me, i give my life to you 'cause you're my destiny. and now, come take me, my soul is yours. as you desire me, i come to you. and now, come take me, my very soul is yours, as you desire me, i come to you.
