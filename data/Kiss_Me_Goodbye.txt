kashmir isimli sukela grubu tanimama vesile olmus sarki. (bkz: iskandinav rock gruplari)
petula clark tan altmışların tüm güzelliğini yansıtan bir şarkı. hele ki yerlerin kar kaplandığı su günlerde ne de güzel dinlenir bir fincan kahve ile dışarısını izleyerek. we choose it, win or lose it love is never quite the same i love you, now i've lost you don't feel bad, you're not to blame so kiss me goodbye and i'll try not to cry all the tears in the world won't change your mind there's someone new and she's waiting for you soon your heart will be leaving me behind linger awhile, then i'll go with a smile like a friend who just happened to call for the last time pretend your are mine my darling, kiss me goodbye i know now i must go now though my heart wants me to stay that girl is your tomorrow i belong to yesterday so kiss me goodbye and i'll try not to cry all the tears in the world won't change your mind there's someone new and she's waiting for you soon your heart will be leaving me behind linger awhile, then i'll go with a smile like a friend who just happened to call for the last time pretend your are mine my darling, kiss me goodbye my darling kiss me goodbye

kashmir'in 1999, sonymusic çıkışlı the good life albümünün 12. track'i. sözleri de yazayım filan... i used to belong here be safe from the world here share wine and believe you'd share yours forever time passes to past tense i walked past the sealed ends pretended i was king with my back turned on the faithful kiss me goodbye kiss me out of your eye shooting star let the clouds pass you by these scents here are yours now mine's blown out but somehow i wish they'd return just can't find a way how never becomes always if you miss all these warnings i sure missed them all dragged you with me falling kiss me goodbye kiss me out of your eye shooting star wet my lips one last time kiss me goodbye kiss me out of your eye shooting star wet my lips one last time kiss me goodbye kiss me out of your eye shooting star let the clouds pass you by
bir veda havasi yoktur aslinda her şeye rağmen bu şarkıda, bir çeşit son çırpınıştır dile gelen.
angela aki nin final fantasy xii için yazdığı şarkı final fantasy klibi şöyle : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyrfp11qj8u sözleri de şöyledir efendim: you say my love is all you need, to see you through but i know these words are not quite true here is the path you're looking for, an open door leading to worlds you long to explore go, if you must move on alone i'm gonna make it on my own kiss me good-bye, love's memory follow your heart and find your destiny won't she'd a tear, for love's mortality for you put the dream in my reality as time goes by i know you'll see this of me: i loved you enough to let you go free go, i will give you wings to fly cast all your fears into the sky kiss me good-bye, love's mystery all of my life i'll hold you close to me won't she'd a tear for love's mortality for you put the dream in my reality kiss me good-bye, love's memory you put the dream in my reality
