bir cole porter sarkısı.
sözleri ise şöyle, aynen aşağıdaki gibi. buyrun bakalım: i know too well that i'm just wasting precious time in thinking such a thing could be that you could ever care for me i'm sure you hate to hear that i adore you, dear but grant me just the same i'm not entirely to blame for love you'd be so easy to love so easy to idolize all others above so worth the yearning for so swell to keep every homefire burning for we'd be so grand at the game so carefree together that it does seem a shame that you can't see your future with me 'cause you'd be oh, so easy to love
