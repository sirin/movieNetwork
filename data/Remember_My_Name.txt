(bkz: fame)
bliss'in huzur veren, mukkemmel sarkisi: summer skies make me realize if you weren´t here nothing would be the same starry nights dancing in the candle lights when the morning comes will you remember my name is it just the time of season do we really mean the things we say all things happen for a reason as night follows the day love that once was strong could fade away could it be our love was destiny we´ve got nothing to lose you know we mustn´t play games spread your wings for you i would do anything when the morning comes will you remember my name
