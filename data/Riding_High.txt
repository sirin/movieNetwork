78 tarihli müthiş faze o şaheseri. o string-synth düzenlemeleri isaac hayes'i bile kıskandırmış olabilir. yok yahu, ike amca kıskançlıktan uzaktır, adamcağız yerinden kalkıp yanına yarini de alıp sabahın 4'ünde impala'sıyla şöyle bir banliyö turu atmıştır en fazla, bu şarkıyı ilk duyduğu an. o yapmadıysa da onun yerine yapmış yüzbinlerce insan varmış ki, bu şarkı ilk çıktığı an milyonların kulakların pasını silerek billboard listesinde ilk 10'u boylamıştır, ridin' high!
