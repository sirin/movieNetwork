kafana girecek olan şeylere biz karar veririz diyolar. phosphene dream albümünden bir the black angels şarkısı. it's quiet and loud no one hears it but us some starving and proud no one chooses but us you can hide upstream we will trap and scalp you change the color of your skin but sure as night we'll find you never meant to hurt no one only meant to move myself yeah, i try and i try 'til i'm red in the face we decide what goes inside your head you see yourself in me how'd you do that? how'd you? beyond your tower's wall he waits on the killing call and he tries and he tries 'til he's red in the face we decide what goes inside your head
