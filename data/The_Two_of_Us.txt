(bkz: suede) lying in my bed i think of you that song goes through my head the one we both knew in each line lies another line full of sacred sound but you're outside where the companies dream and the money goes round lying in my bed. watching my mistakes i listen to the band they said that it could be the 2 of us the snow might fall and write the lines on the silent page but you're outside making permanent love to the nuclear age two silhouettes by the cash machine make a lovers dance it's a tango for the lonely wives of the business class lying in my bed watching my mistakes i listen to the band lying in my bed with nothing much to say so i listen to the man he said that it could be the 2 of us i heard you call from across the city through the stereo sound and so i crawled there sickeningly pretty as the money went round lying in my head watching my mistakes i listen to the band and the drums beat in my head pianos chime the sound in this prison of the house and as the illness comes again can you hear me through the rain as i listen to the band? as i sing the silent song mime each lonely word please listen to the man he said that it could be the 2 of us alone but not lonely, you and me alone but loaded.........
