tori amos'un strange little girls albümünde coverladığı joe jackson parçası: take your mind back i don't know when sometime when it always seemed to be just us and them girls that wore pink and boys that wore blue boys that always grew up better men than me and you what's a man now what's a man mean is he rough or is he rugged cultural and clean now it's all changed it's got to change more we think it's getting better but nobody's really sure and so it goes, go round again but now and then we wonder who the real men are see the nice boys dancing in pairs golden earring, golden tan blow-wave in the hair sure they're all straight, straight as a line all the guys are macho see their leather shine you don't want to sound dumb don't want to offend so don't call me a faggot not unless you are a friend then if you're tall and handsome and strong you can wear the uniform and i could play along and so it goes, go round again but now and then we wonder who the real men are time to get scared time to change plan don't know how to treat a lady don't know how to be a man time to admit what you call defeat 'cause there's women running past you now and you just drag your feet man makes a gun man goes to war man can kill and man can drink and man can take a whore kill all the blacks kill all the reds if there's war between the sexes then there'll be no people left and so it goes, go round again but now and then we wonder who the real men are and so it goes, go round again but now and then we wonder who the real men are and so it goes, go round again but now and then we wonder who the real men are
1987 yapımı, james belushi'nin özel çok gizli ajan modunda ruslarla içli dışlı olduğu bir komedi filmi.
sözlerinden de anlaşılabileceği gibi tori erkeklere dokundurur lafı bu şarkıda. toriden gelen başım üstüne.
"kill all the blacks, kill all the reds, if there's a war between the sexes then there'll be no people left.. " gibi muhtesem sozlere sahip sarki..
playboy mommyde anlattıklarıyla bağlantılı olan şarkıdır, bence bu yüzden bu şarkıyı seçmiştir tori amos. "then if you're tall and handsome and strong you can wear the uniform and i could play along" edit 2010: yok lan.
en şahane tori amos coverlarından biridir.
