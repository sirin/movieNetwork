kate bush şarkısıdır.. muhteşem hounds of love albümündendir, güzeldir... they look down at the ground, missing. but i never go in now - i'm looking at the big sky, i'm looking at the big sky now, i'm looking at the big sky you never understood me, you never really tried. that cloud, that cloud - looks like ireland, c'mon and blow it a kiss now. but quick 'coz it's changing in the big sky it's changing in the big sky now. we're looking at the big sky. you never understood me you never really tried. this cloud, this cloud says "noah, c'mon and build me an ark" and if you're coming - jump 'coz we're leaving with the big sky and we pause for the jets hup, hup in the big sky you want my reply? what was the question? i was looking at the big sky.
