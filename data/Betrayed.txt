house of night series in 2. kitabı. ilk kitaba göre daha heycanlı ve sürükleyici. ilk kitapta güvendiğimiz tüm kişilerin güvenilmez olduğunu öğrenirken 3. sünü bir an önce okuma hevesi bırakıyor.

metal church'un 91 tarihli efsane the human factor albümünden güzel şarkı. i've been waking up shaking, and the bottles are gone what will i do with my day, and how will i get along i need a replacement for the habit i have i just need to get something, i can't live in the past the craving grows stronger the longer i'm away the pain cuts deeper each bottle i betray what looks like it's harmless, is rotten inside what you don't know might not hurt you until after you die i've always thought when you grow up somehow you get wise but i've been living in a nightware behind a party disguise the craving grows stronger the longer i'm away the pain cuts deeper each bottle i betray just take a drink and you will find yourself back where you started temptation is the hardest thing, just push it all away once you take the first step, there'll be no more turning back just take a look at how far you progressed to be sober lose faith in yourself, off the wagon you will fall staying clean and sober is the only way to go what looks like it's harmless, is rotten inside what you don't know might not hurt you until after you die i've always thought when you grow up somehow you get wise but i've been living in a nightware behind a party disguise the craving grows stronger the longer i'm away the pain cuts deeper each bottle i betray
