journey şarkısı. 2005 yılında çıkan generations albümünün son şarkısı. sözler: so long ago, has it been that long since we felt the sun where has it gone to has it hid from the world have we lost our way i can remember it filling the sky and it'd warm my face the summers were endless but they're over now that was yesterday i know we'll find love again if we all pray a little the heart will break free beyond the clouds that's where my soul waits she's waiting now beyond the clouds sorrow seems endless now there's only so much that a man can bear hold on so tender to a glimmer of faith gets me half way there i know it will shine again with some prayer and some patience we'll find our way home beyond the clouds that's where my soul waits she's waiting now just beyond beyond anything you've ever known oh, so beautiful like a summer sky oh, you know it won't be long if we find the strength i know there beyond the clouds we'll find the sun beyond the clouds that's where my soul waits, oh yeah she's waiting now beyond beyond the clouds that's where my love waits she's waiting now beyond the clouds yeah, that's it now, ooh oh, that's it now, baby, ooh beyond everything you've ever known oh, if i could find the strength, i know we'll find the sun
