marillion imzalı misplaced childhood albümünün harika kapanış parçası... lyrics: dick music: dick/kelly/mosley/rothery/trewavas when i hit the streets back in '81 found a heart in the gutter and a poet's crown i felt barbed wire kisses and icicle tears where have i been for all these years? i saw political intrigue, political lies gonna wipe those smiles of self-satisfaction from their eyes i will wear your white feather i will carry your white flag i will swear i have no nation but i'm proud to own my heart i will wear your white feather i will carry your white flag i will swear i have no nation but i'm proud to own my heart my heart, this is my heart we don't need no uniforms, we have no disguise divided we stand, together we'll rise we will wear your white feather we will carry your white flag we will swear we have no nations but we're proud to own our hearts we will wear your white feather we will carry your white flag we will swear we have no nations but we're proud to own our hearts these are our hearts these are our hearts you can't take away our hearts you can't steal our hearts away i can't walk away no more
yarısında ortaya çıkan harika bi flüt ezgisine sahip olan marillion şarkısı
