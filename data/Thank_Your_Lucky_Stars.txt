bir 311 sarkısı. hemen sozleri verelim: i need a break something inside me said the t.v. people counting the dead a break from all the sadness is what i need now, yeah i remain at a loss for words apathy i sense in the hurt a colder man is senseless no questioning yet and what's the point nothing so dull could ever on earth be brightened in entirely just think about it and what's the point nothing so sly could ever on earth be enlightened entirely just think about it ask me if i'm not blind i can, i can read all the signs so many have died so many out of their minds thank your lucky stars you got it good it's not hard to be what you are thank your lucky stars we're in a place i thought we'd never get people involved that fought or they fled running around know how we're going to get out of it, woah it's a mistake to be paranoid a mental state that takes strength to avoid all the hostility and fierce truth we challenge here's what's the point of living that way so many close their minds to what others say which ever feeling you voice and what's the point we're gonna pay so that i won't wait ?? we'll all have that day so make a choice ask me if i'm not blind i can, i can read all the signs so many have died so many out of their minds thank your lucky stars you got it good it's not hard to be what you are thank your lucky stars ask me if i'm not blind i can, i can read all the signs so many have died so many out of their minds thank your lucky stars you got it good it's not hard to be what you are thank your lucky stars
