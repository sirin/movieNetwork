office space filminin sozleri super olan soundtracki... biz modern kole'lerin elbet birgun avazimiz ciktigi kadar haykirarak sarfedecegimiz, modern sahiplerimize ithaf edecegimiz beste ahanda bunlarda sozleri. yo 6 o'clock every morning you waking up yawning to the sound of your alarm clock alarm about an hour from now you should be at the place of employment which is annoying cause it's so boring your co-workers are talking too loud for you to ignore them it affects your occupational performance you wonder why your work load is so enormous because your boss just laid off three quarters of the whole office people get depressed, they get ulcers from the stress that the corporate environment causes regardless of how you ultimately wanna solve this seems to me like you've got one of four choices: you could take a new job offer for more chips stick it out a little longer or forfeit but my advice to anybody that wants to quit it'll feel much better if you say it like this: take this job and shove it i ain't workin here no more take this job and shove it i ain't workin here no more take this job and shove it i ain't workin here no more take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it yo, if your boss is a s-o-b tell him to s-h-o-v-e the j-o-b put your middle finger up slowly put it close enough to his face so he can examine it closely say i ain't workin here no more who do you think you are? rip your apron off, throw it on the floor run to the door, to the payphone make a toll-free call tell your spouse what happened and where you are so they can come and get you in the car later on and help you search for a new 9 to 5 job if the unemployment line ain't that long you can take your time printin out w-9 forms eventually, you'll get on if you try hard enough and you'll get money if you keep punchin your time card enough maybe you hate it, maybe you love it but if you hate it all you gotta do is get mad and tell the boss to take this job and shove it i ain't workin here no more take this job and shove it i ain't workin here no more take this job and shove it i ain't workin here no more take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it yo, some occupations are like slave gigs the boss is favored and get placed in something spacious while the most hated get placed in some small cubicle spaces or get thrown down in the basement, get your stapler confiscated you constantly waitin for a paycheck twelve months passed by and you still ain't get paid yet here's a optimistic motto if you ever late for today you could say you early for tomorrow most 9 to 5
