"we’ll do it doggy style so we can both watch x-files" sozlerine sahip bad touch sarkisini cagristiran sarki
marilyn monroe something s got to give filminden kovulunca ve ardindan da olunce yerine doris day'i alirlar, ve "move over, darling" adi altinda yeniden cekerler. bu filmin yerlisini de yaptilar degisiklikler yaparak, turkan soray oynadiydi.
doris day'in kadife sesiyle soyledigi , yumusacık, sıcak cikolata tadında bir sarkı.
