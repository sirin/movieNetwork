suedein head music adli albümünden cant get enough singleinda bulunan bir b sidei. radyo eksende duymam beni dumura uğratmıştır. sözleri ise: since you went away every night and day i've been drinking too much wine i've been sitting in doorways on circle lines since you went away every night and day i've been staring into space i've been stumbling slowly through cityscapes and i go where the people go and i see summer laugh at me what's that mean? since you went away every night and day well, i've just been marking time i've been staring at buildings and traffic signs since you went away every night and day i've been wandering around i've been sat by the tv with the sound turned down and i go where the people go and i see summer laugh at me what's that mean? and i go where the people go and i see summer laugh at me what's that mean? and i go where the people go and i see summer laugh at me what's that mean?
autumn leaves adlı şarkının da bir cümlesidir. şöyle ki: since you went away the days grow old and soon i hear old winter song but i miss you most of all my darling when autumn leaves starts to fall
as my guitar lies bleeding in my armsin nakaratindan bi bolum; i can't write a love song the way i feel today i can't sing no song of hope, i got nothing to say life is feeling kinda strange, since you went away i sing this song to you wherever you are as my guitar lies bleeding in my arms.. ay'leri yavsak yavsak, uzatarak soyler jon, cok tatlidir.
sevilen/fazlaca önemsenen birinin uzaklara gitmesinin sonuçlarını anlatan sözleri; sakin/acıklı, tefli müziği ile(sonundaki ıslık solosuna dikkat!) suede'in kimselerin iplemediği son dönemine ait en favori parçam*
hayatin anlamini birkac cumlede ozetlemeye calismayan, sessiz-sade, icinden geleni oldugu gibi soylemis brett anderson. gunesli bir veda parcasi sanki, buruk ama kirgin degil, zaman gerekiyor sadece "well, i've just been marking time".
