1955 yapımı bir frilm ayrıca aynı filmden frank sinatra'nın seslendirdiği bir şarkı (love is) the tender trap sammy cahn yazmıştır. frank sinatra da son derece keyifli bir hale getirmiştir. şarkı olanın sözleri ya see a pair of laughing eyes, and suddenly you're sighing sighs. you're thinkin' nothin's wrong, you string along, boy, then snap! those eyes, those sighs - they're part of the tender trap. you're hand in hand beneath the trees, and soon there's music in the breeze. you're actin' kind of smug until your heart just goes whap! those trees, that breeze - they're part of the tender trap. some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle, she'll hold you tight and you'll hate yourself for being single. and all at once it seems so nice, the folks are throwin' shoes and rice. you hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map. you're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap. some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle, she'll hold you tight and you'll hate yourself for bein' single. and all at once it seems so nice, the folks are throwin' shoes and rice. you hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map. and then you wonder how it all came about, it's too late now, there's no gettin' out you fell in love, and love is the tender trap.
frank sinatra'nın en güzellerinden. yalnız bu şarkıyı kesinlikle michael buble'den de dinlemek isterim. sesine, tarzına mükemmel derecede uyacağını düşünüyorum.
stacey kent'in de bu ismi taşıyan 1998 çıkışlı bir albümü bulunmakta, kanımca playlist aşağıdaki gibi: 1. tender trap 2. i didn't know about you 3. comes love 4. in the still of the night 5. fools rush in 6. east of the sun 7. zing! went the strings of my heart 8. they say it's wonderful 9. don't be that way 10. they all laughed 11. in the wee small hours of the morning 12. it's a wonderful world
