(bkz: sedotta e abbandonata)
realism albümünden bir the magnetic fields şarkısı. sözleri seduced and abandoned and baby makes two, baby, abandoned by you seduced and abandoned and what can i do? i think i might drink a few seduced with a grin, i was taken all in taken in sin and in shame seduced by a smile, i walked down the aisle, then waited awhile; no one came... abandoned to weep i collapsed in a heap, dutifully sleep- ing all day abandoned to die i did nothing but cry in my one-ply negligee... yes, i think i might drink a few and maybe the baby will too
