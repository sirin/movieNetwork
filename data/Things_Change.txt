atrophy - violent by nature şarkısı. forced to deal with decisions you never thought come true abandoned by the ones you've trusted, no one's there for you internal maelstrom of confusion, unsure of who you are the things you used in definition didn't take you very far chorus: the things i felt before i'm not sure if they're there words which meant so much fall on ears which just don't care emotions all entangled, it's time to reearrange the seasons pass, emotions die, i'm helpless as things change we often times define ourselves by our titles and our friends we place our trust in fallacies which eventually will end but just like dreams that fade away with every morning's light we're left with only memories, no tangibles in sight repeat chorus solo: lykins now i find i'm all alone and wondering what is real insecure of who i am, afraid of what i feel but i'm on the path to knowledge, the darkness won't last longer that which does not kill me, only makes me stronger repeat chorus things change things change things change things change

bluetones sarkisi. how will you ever learn, when your hands are tied and your bridges burned? when will you get to see that your only option lies with me? must you be kicked right down, ripped from limb taught to drown, but told to swim the way to be, the way to act is not to preach what you practice things change, but a part of its present formula remains things needn’t be so if you let me through (x3)
