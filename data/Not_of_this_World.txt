danzig'in danzig albümünden gayet ehlenceli bir başka şarkı. sözleri şöyledir: not of this world and nothing bites like i do nothing screams out loud in this empty night nothing can keep me from you and you think that you know the reason i'm alive truth is you only know the lies not of this world and nothing can hold it back i am the dawn upon your bloody beach come to pass not of this world for i am nothing known when the seasons shift they call my name to carry me home and you think that you know the reason i'm alive truth is you only know the lies and i feel all the things you could never understand choose where you stand am i mortal are you man not of this world nothing bites like i do nothing screams out loud in this empty night nothing can keep me from you choose where you stand am i mortal are you man yea not of this world for i am nothing known when the seasons shift they call my name to carry me home
