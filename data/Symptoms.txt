alanis morissette'in hands clean single ında bulunan çok başarılı bir şarkı. sözleri şu şekildedir: the missle sent today killed only 3 the rest were saved, they're far enough away to not really feel the direct effect on me they caught him today based ridicuolusly on his race they weren't sure he even did it but they needed a random face all these symptoms, symptoms of a simpler cause i've had moments in my life when i've contributed by believing we are seperate, we are seperate dissconnected in this unity he won today, smug self-satisfaction on his face he blew the others out of the water he said and was glad they were disgraced all these symptoms, symptoms of a simpler cause i've had moments in my life when i've contributed by believing we are seperate, we are seperate dissconnected in this unity he stole what he could he only had minutes before he'd be caught he justified every penny taken by blaming the gap between the rich and rich not all these symptoms, symptoms of a simpler cause i've had moments in my life when i've contributed by believing we are seperate, we are seperate dissconnected in this unity
