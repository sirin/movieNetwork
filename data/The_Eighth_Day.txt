sun caged'in dream theater'vari (when dream and day unite era) parçasi... ayni isimli albümde yer almakta... mourn the death you celebrate love the ones you used to hate place of sorrow, guide our hand murdering the innocent break down to me if all is wasted endlessly your loss and gain your smiles and pain among with all that will remain won't be long don't be afraid to feel is just a passing state break down to me if all is wasted endlessly your loss and gain your smiles and pain among with all that will remain throw your stones your sins all known i'll take back that what i gave don't mind possessions that they save (and)until then in little waves deliver me the food i crave regardless of what they say, don't just let us drift away loneliness our smiles of gray, our solitude on the eighth day break down to me if all is wasted endlessly your loss and gain your smiles and pain among with all that will remain nothing i'm afraid....
