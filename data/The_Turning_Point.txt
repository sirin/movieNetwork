lacrimosa'nın 1999 yılı çıkışlı elodia albümünün 4. parçası... poutaisat pilvet haihtuvat katoen nopesti tuulten mukana kuin tama uni jossa en enaa sinua tavoita on liian myohaista in a dream i saw the world beyond - no tongues telling lies the silence was covering everything inside in a dream i saw myself - fallen down next to me couldn't crawl back inside my body no laughter on my face - reality mirrored in the deep signs of life too long sacrificed my feelings to the ones who take all 'till there's nothing in the end i'm not in my aim - i've gotta love also the other half of me to reach the turning point as only in my dreams i'm my biggest enemy till i'd found out that i only loved your half in me so much time i spent - not knowing myself too much love i'd given for everyone but nothing for me my light was burning 'till the end now you showed me that two full halves make a stronger one also out of me and i feel the strength returning into me i new-found love again couldn't have been fighting alone thank you for hearing me on time i bless you for the trust you gave when i didn't admit being weak i am close to my aim truly hoping i won't fail before i reach the turning point where we're no longer the same didn't notice me change was not living the days without names now i'm here with you to stay beyond the turning point of my dreams o found my aim - now i can face myself again i thank you for loving me and keeping us on the right way
