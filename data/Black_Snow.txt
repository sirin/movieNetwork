anlamsizlik sarkisi, puressence'in erken donemlerine ait herhangi bir albumde olmayan parcasi. o kadar anlamsizdir ki hersey, "neden ruzgar eser? neden agaclar buyur?" bilinmez, zaten neden herkes evine gitmiyor ki?.. i don't know why the wind blows, i don't know why the trees grow, i don't know why there's black snow, at the end of my rainbow, why it's cold in the summer, why it's warm in the winter, i sign my giro in biro, drinking lager or bitter, oh you can stand beside me, you can walk behind me, you can stand beside me, you can walk behind me, why don't we all just go home, why don't we all just go home, i don't know why the flames burn, i don't know why my head aches, i don't know which way to turn, i don't know how to slam on the brakes, i don't know why the wind blows, i don't know why the trees grow, i don't know why there's black snow, at the end of my rainbow, you can stand beside me, you can walk behind me, why don't we all just go home...
