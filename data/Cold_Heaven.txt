axel rudi pell'in kings and queens albümünün en güzel parçalarından biri. sözleri şu şekildedir: you call yourself a lady with innocent eyes but your mind drive's me crazy a devil in disguise burnin' nights of passion lasting from dusk till dawn falling in and out of romance forever on and on the heart of the moment's hiding your cold hearted lies inordinate torment a waste of time cold heaven feels like hell you're heart's like a stone you drive me insane cold heaven nothing more to tell better leave you alone love's not a game i used to be your romeo your master of sin but you behave like a gambler playing games you can't win extinguish the fire been blinded by the flame but there's no more desire don't want to feel your pain
