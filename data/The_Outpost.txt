sunless days adli albumdeki bir diger muhte$em beseech parcasi. sozleri de $oyle olsa gerek: i have been where silence dwell tried to keep you far away i feel something's still around it has been kept from us all illusions are just fractions of the fears that they stole from your mind i can touch what you can't reach i cannot hold them back all illusions seem so real i can touch what you can't reach i cannot hold them back it's the outpost of my mind when the darkness came you saw now i share what you believe you are in my silent room now i understand it all illusions were just fractions of the fears you carried all the way now you touch what i have reached you cannot hold them back all illusions seem so real now you touch what i have reached you cannot hold them back it's the outpost of our minds i can touch what you can't reach i cannot hold them back all illusions seem so real i can touch what you can't reach i cannot hold them back it's the outpost of my mind
