kylie minogueun yeni bombası. süper şarkı.
şarkı kylie minogue için yazılmıştır ama seslendiren kylie değil şarkının yazarlarından mia j'dir. sesle, kylie'ninkine benzesin ve daha iyi bir demo olsun diye bilgisayar ortamında biraz oynanmıştır. sözlerini de yazayım tam olsun: it's got to be time that i put my foot down you push me and pull me with those games your playin' and you know what goes around comes around cause i started hearing all the words they're saying you're so conceited i won't be cheated (just listen) one little push and you're gone everytime the cat's away all the boys come out to play it’s bad behaviour but i like the flavour a little bird told me it’s true so i do it back to you nice girls don't do it but you push me too it ooohh oooooh ha ha ha i'm needing some liberation set me free you tried to control me but i'm disobeying i'm tired of you giving me the third degree when i've got a lead on you to stop you strayin' you're so conceited i won't be cheated (just listen) one little push and you're gone everytime the cat's away all the boys come out to play it’s bad behaviour but i like the flavour a little bird told me it’s true so i do it back to you nice girls don't do it but you pushed me to it ooohh oooooh ha ha ha everytime the cat's away all the boys come out to play it’s bad behaviour but i like the flavour a little bird told me it’s true so i do it back to you nice girls don't do it but you push me to it ooohh oooooh ha ha ha everytime the cat's away all the boys come out to play it’s bad behaviour but i like the flavour a little bird told me it’s true so i do it back to you nice girls don't do it but you push me to it ooohh oooooh ha ha ha everytime the cat's away a little bird told me it’s true everytime the cat's away a little bird told me it’s true everytime the cat's away a little bird told me it’s true
