black sabbath - seventh star albümünden bir şarkı. in the days of confusion you've turned angry and cold you say it's an ilusion there's no fire in your soul say you don't love me say you don't care but don't leave me standing here your heart's like a wheel just waiting to roll it's longing for freedom to get out on the road you're hungry for something that you may never find so many reasons your love has made you blind you say you don't love me you say you don't care so don't leave me standing here don't leave me standing here you say you don't love me you say you don't care don't leave me don't leave me standing here life ain't been easy full of passion and pain told me no reason why i was to blame don't leave me standing don't leave me standing don't leave me standing on my own
