wild america albümünde bulununan kıpır kıpır, eğlence dozu yüksek tora tora şarkısı. a gifted man, he works so smooth slight of hand, his every move twist of fate, has touched his life slap to the face, he won't rise and shine innocence has lost it's style, oooooohhh look at these eyes of sorrow see in this face of pain look through the eyes of tomorrow see this face of shame flood of lies, keep getting deeper nowhere to hide, come down with cold fever love is blind, now you see you got cold cold fever alibis keep getting cheaper no way to fight, come down with cold fever no surprise , you fall to pieces you got cold cold fever to leave his past he'd sell his soul the truth at last will let him go tells himself he's justified emotions burning deep inside as a shadow fades into the night, oooooohhh look at these eyes of sorrow see in this face of pain look through the eyes of tomorrow see this face of shame flood of lies, keep getting deeper nowhere to hide, come down with cold fever love is blind, now you see you got cold cold fever alibis keep getting cheaper no way to fight, come down with cold fever no surprise , you fall to pieces you got cold cold fever
