the good the bad and the queen albumundeki 11 numarali sarki. damon albarn, "bir sarkiya dair bir sarki " olmasi sebebiyle sarkiyi "tuhaf" olarak tanimlamis. hikayenin gerisi roll da okunabilir, sozleri icin de asagiya bakilabilir. i wrote this song late at night years ago somewhere on the goldhawk road i was never sure how or why before the war and the tidal wave engulfed us it’s true how the world has changed and i was learning how to change with you we saw the green fields turn into stone such lonely homes all in a bad mans dream he ain’t asleep it’s a dream in the darkest hour the song had gone it passed among people i hardly knew i was loosing all the time she stayed with me and found me out and above all things i’ve learnt it’s the honesty that secures the bond in the heart
şevket uğurluer tarafından söylenmiş, naif şarkı. http://www.youtube.com/…tgyhzigsdhk&feature=related
