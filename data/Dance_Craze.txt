millencolinin same old tunes albümünden gaz bir parça olsa gerek... i'm in the bar when i should be in front of you i play the pinball when i really should be skanking it dosn't matter how many times you ask me up i appreciate it but it's complicated, i just can't dance baby i just can't loose myself i've got an image and i have to live up on to the latest trend so nowdays i'm macho and have you ever seen a macho shake or twist his butt, i know your not so i'm not lickin' in on the spot 'cause i can't dance baby, i just can't get in trance someone told me bad boys don't know why they´re not dancing someone told me what they say is their only way to slip away
