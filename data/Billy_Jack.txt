yil olmus 2006, bu sarki nasil sozlukte olmaz anlamak mumkun degil. herhalde bir yazar ucmasi soz konusu. neyse efendim sarki orjinalde curtis mayfield sarkisi olur, fakat benim orjinalini dinlemisligim yoktur. lakin tadindan yenmez bir lenny kravitz cover'i vardir ki o da a tribute to curtis mayfield albumunde yer aliyormus. sozlerini de yazalim tam olsun, bu ayip kalksin ortadan. cik cik cik... just out of monday run into a friend down the street, down the street where i live ah! ah! sad things begin i could feel from within from the message, from the message he had to give 'bout a buddy of mine running out of time somebody past noon, shot across the room and now the man no longer lives too bad about him too sad about him don't get me wrong, the man is gone but it's a wonder he lived this long up in the city they called him boss jack but down home he was a alley cat ah! didn't care nothing about being black oh! billy jack can't be no fun (can't be no fun) to be shot, shot with a hand gun body sprawled out, you without a doubt running people out, there on the floor, oh oh oh ah! ah! bad bloody bloody mess shot all up in his chest one sided duel, gun and a fool what a way to go up in the city they called him boss jack but down home he was a alley cat ah! didn't care nothin' 'bout being black ah, oh, billy jack ah! ah! ah! ah!
her ritmiyle huzur veren şarkı. biri bu şarkı için "insana gözlerini kapattırıp zorla hayal kurduran şarkılar var." demiş. az bile söylemiş. lenny kravitz'in sesini zaten severdim, bu yorumla gözümde on kademe atladın lenny.
