bir kreator - outcast şarkısı. one by one we take control new consciousness, one heart, one soul oppression ends, the time has come so don't look back, it can be done something is still missing something keeps 'em blind like a prescious sacrilege they can never find so they walk together into a silent war though it seems to take forever this generation is finaly heading for... a better tomorrow tell me can't you feel it? tell me can't you see it? tell me can't you hear it? i know it ain't just me let us walk together what are we waiting for? it is now or never this generation is finaly heading for... a better tomorrow day by day we're praying for, it to come across the shores it brings new hope, it brings new light nameless spirits now they shine one by one become aware new consciousness will be there and all the blind now they will see, embrace their minds to plant the seeds for... a better tomorrow
