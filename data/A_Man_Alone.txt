müthiş sözlere sahip bir frank sinatra şarkısı. in me you see a man alone held by the habit of being on his own a man who listens to the trembling of the trees with sentimentals ease in me you see a man alone behind the wall he's learned to call his home a man who still goes walking in the rain expecting love again. a man not lonely except when the dark comes on a man learning to live with memories of midnights that fell apart at dawn in me you see a man alone drinking up sundays and spending them alone a man who knows love is seldom what it seems only other people's dreams. a man learning to live with memories of midnights that fell apart at dawn in me you see a man alone drinking up sundays and spending them alone a man who knows love is seldom what it seems just other people's dreams.
