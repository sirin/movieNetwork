virgin steele'in book of burning albümündeki akustik parçası. bir başka versiyonu ise guardians of the flame albümünde yer alır. sözleri: a cry in the night i'm still hearing no my love is gone i must be dreaming lost in the mist of passions strange wiping the tears i recall the pain of love and laughter, joy now slain when your world turns cold won't you call my name come on cry out in the dark i'll be by your side to give you warmth and light and shield you from the night hold on, hold on, we'll fan the flames of love together again, just you and i i watched the faces in the fire no emotion was ever there if this is truth then who's the liar? your eyes are blind, they don't love you you're just an amusement, thought of with disdain but i'm still waiting, won't you call my name you say your heart is open to loves call and you can't refuse it's refrain but you don't hear the real sirens song echoing it's refrain, my love still remains so
