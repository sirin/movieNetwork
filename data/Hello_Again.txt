the cars'ın bir şarkısı, 1984 yapımı "heartbeat city" albümünden. aynı albümden ünlü drive'ın gölgesinde kalmıştı, güzel şarkıdır* tabii. (tekrar merhaba, selam yeniden...) you might have forgot the journey ends you tied your knots you made your friends you left the scene without a trace one hand on the ground one hand in space you passed on mercy you tried the rest you gave your body you gave your best staring at the green door living in the sky you don't want to know it you just want to fly hello, hello, hello hello again hello, hello, hello hello again i know you're a dreamer who's under the gun i know you're a dreamer who's only just begun and when there's nothing nothing left to lose you leave it all to fade to blue you want to feel electric you want to feel loose you want to be eclectic you want to calla truce look at the profile staring at the flame waiting for the sunshine standing in the rain

ayrica hoobastankin bir parcasi. i dream that someday we'll be able to look back on this together and say it was for the best and that it made us stronger today, stronger today there's much more for us to see a brand new day for you and me and with confidence i say we're better than ever and i don't know where this will lead but in my life you need to be cause i need to say hello again i'm so afraid that if i wait too long you'll never look in my eyes again with a look that gave me strength and gave me hope and made me feel i've inspired there's much more for us to see a brand new day for you and me and with confidence i say we're better than ever and i don't know where this will lead but in my life you need to be cause i need to say hello again hello again hello again hello again there's much more for us to see a brand new day for you and me and with confidence i say we're better than ever and i don't know where this will lead but in my life you need to be cause i need to say hello again there's much more for us to see a brand new day for you and me and with confidence i say we're better than ever and i don't know where this will lead but in my life you need to be cause i need to say hello again
kendini zorla söyleten bir barı$ma $arkısı* .
nefis bir neil diamond şarkısı. feci bir kaza yapıp yolda sekiz kere dönerken dinlemek keyifli oluyor.
insanı alıp götüren amos lee şarkısı. canlı versiyonu şurdan: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-4pcozaroe dinlenebilir. hello again, i know it's been a long time coming you say you've been, been now a long time running you used to be, so beautiful but you lost it somewhere along the way you used to be so beautiful but it's easy now to walk away that wonder wall you're waiting for is now collapsing tell me more, but wait no no let me find out what you're asking for you used to be, so beautiful but you lost it somewhere along the way you used to be so beautiful and it's easy now to walk away away, away now you have everything you have ever wanted oh it's so sad to see when the hunter becomes the hunted
