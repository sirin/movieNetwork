symphony x'in 2011'de çıkan iconoclast albümünün 2. şarkısı. (5.27) bite your tongue the blackened sun will curse the moon skies of fire nothing's worth a damn calculate anticipate your every move beware the ruthless hearts of man feel my pain my words are in vain i believe it's the end of innocence don't look away oh, hear what i say i believe it's the end of innocence cut and splice a fierce device degenerate sons of light synthetic gods, our man crushed beneath the dragon beast breathing hate your blood your blood is on their hands feel my pain my words are in vain i believe it's the end of innocence don't look away oh, hear what i say i believe it's the end of innocence the world is dying the precious sands of time are running out we are the fallen, made obsolete methodically phased out ...feel my pain feel my pain my words are in vain i believe it's the end of innocence don't look away oh, hear what i say i believe it's the end, it's the end of innocence
