still got the blues albümünden gary moore parçası. she's that kind of woman. no doubt about how she feels. she's holding promises. her eyes won't tell, her lips are sealed. and i like her like that. she's kind of crazy. i think i know what i'm looking for. that kind of woman. i think i know what i'm looking for. that kind of woman. standing in the doorway with the sunlight in her hair. she's watching the wind blow. you know she don't have a care. i like her like that. she's kind of crazy. i think i know what i'm looking for. that kind of woman. i think i know what i'm looking for. that kind of woman. she's got to look so cool, you know what i mean. got the wickedest smile that i've ever seen. i crashed my heart on the side of the street that she once stood on. she's that kind of woman. i like her like that. she's pretty amazing. i understand why i want some more. that kind of woman. one look from her knocks me on the floor. that kind of woman. she's that kind of lady that you meet in a dream of dreams. puts others in her shadow, but you know this woman's real. and i like her that. she's kind of crazy. i think i know what i'm looking for. that kind of woman. i think i know what i'm looking for. that kind of woman. i think i know what i'm looking for. that kind of woman. i said i know what i'm looking for. that kind of woman. that kind of woman. that kind of woman.
