bir babyface $arkisi. sozlerini de yazayim tam olsun: i can't sleep at night i toss and turn listenin' for the telephone but when i get your call i'm all choked up can't believe you called my home and as a matter of fact it blows my mind you would even talk to me because a girl like you is like a dream come true a real life fantasy no matter what your friends try to tell you we were made to fall in love and we will be together, any kind of weather it's like that, it's like that, girl every little step i take, you will be there every little step i make, we'll be together every little step i take, you will be there every little step i make, we'll be together i can't think too straight, i'm all confused you must've put a thing on me because there are no words that can explain i'm living in ecstasy and you can best believe i've got your back you never have to feel no pain because i dedicate my life for you you never have to love again no matter what your friends try to tell you we were made to fall in love we'll always be together, any kind of weather it's like that, it's like that hook 2 times no matter what your friends try to tell you we were made to fall in love and we will be together, any kind of weather it's like that, it's like that hook 3 times
