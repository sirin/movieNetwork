emily haines'in knives don't have your back albumunden hos bir parca.sozleri soyledir: hover through the foggy vapours, until i see you in a dream, singing animals to sleep... by the way, it's over without you. i'm in the way, i'm in the way. i'm in the way, i'm in the way. lights out to midnight. sleep all day (yeah, yeah, yeah) (sha la la la) dark and quiet, only the owls are watching, only the sky is up and i'm leaving for a place (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) from another time, just to be near you, just to be near you, just to be near you (sha la la la la la la la la..) i'm in the way, i'm in the way. i'm in the way, i'm in the way, i'm in the way. i'm in the way, i'm in the way... don't become the one you hated. death is absolutely safe, billion bibles mark the last page. i've gotta roll through the days without you here i get a shock, shock hurts to heal i've gotta roll through the weeks without you here i get a shock, shock hurts to heal i've gotta roll through the months without you here i get a shock, shock hurts to heal i've gotta roll through the weeks without you here, i get a shock, shock hurts to heal i've gotta roll through the weeks without you here i get a shock, shock hurts to heal shock, shock hurts to heal hurts to heal hurts to heal hurts to heal
