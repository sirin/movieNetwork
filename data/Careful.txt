çok güzel bir michelle featherstone şarkısı, how i met your motherın 4x23 (as fast as she can) bölümünün sonunda da çalar. sözleri: it's the little things they pulled me in and i'm defenceless i try to ignore like i've done before but it's just useless i've made up my mind that i'm gonna let you in and i'm not afraid but i have to say this is gonna hurt if it ever ends but somehow you out shattered my defence this is gonna hurt if it ever starts so promise you'll be careful with my heart it's the things you do they made me fall hard for you and i can't help it and it's every day that i feel this way so just don't stop it i've made up my mind that i'm gonna let you in and i'm not afraid but i have to say this is gonna hurt if it ever ends but somehow you out shattered my defence this is gonna hurt if it ever starts so promise you'll be careful with my heart i won't make excuses they just all seem useless you don't have the time i guess i'll take my chances now that i know love is on the line this is gonna hurt if it ever ends but somehow you out shattered my defence this is gonna hurt if it ever starts so promise you'll be careful with my heart careful with my heart careful with my heart
paramore un brand new eyes albümünün çok güzel olan ilk parçası. i've settled down a twisted up frown disguised as a smile well, you would have never known i had it all, but not what i wanted cause hope for me was a place uncharted and overgrown you'd make your way in i'd resist you just like this you can't tell me to feel the truth never set me free so i did it myself you can't be too careful anymore when all that is waiting for you won't come any closer you've got to reach out a little more more more more more open your eyes like i open mine it's only the real world life you will never know shifting your way to throw off the pain well you can ignore it but only for so long you look like i did you resist me just like this you can't tell me to heal and it hurts remembering how it felt to shut down you can't be too careful anymore when all that is waiting for you won't come any closer you've got to reach out a little more more more more more the truth never set me free (x3) so i'll do it myself you can't be too careful anymore when all that is waiting for you won't come any closer you've got to reach out you can't be too careful anymore when all that is waiting for you won't come any closer you've got to reach out more more more more more
1992 yapimi kultlesmis guy maddin filmi. en basarili uc filmi arasinda gosterilir. bu garip ve de olaganustu komik melodrama, zamaninda elestirmenler bile "hee?" tepkisi vermistir.
bakesale albümünde yer alan bir sebadoh efsanesi. sözlere mi konsantre olsam rifflere mi takılsam hiç bilemedim bilmek de istemiyorum. drop your guard, i'll get to know you simon says it's time to move and god only knows i think about you 'cause it's never time to show and prove it's never time to show and prove hiding all the time destroys me never know what's right to do i only needed to feel a balance i just want to do right by you sitting safe beside the truth beside you watch out for my bullshit everybody's got it careful as a soldier we're so strong begging my new teacher thought you'd never reach her she's standing there in front of you it's twice as hard to fool us it's twice as hard to fool us careful as a soldier we're so strong careful as a soldier we're so strong
