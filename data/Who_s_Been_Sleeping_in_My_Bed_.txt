sanki lost dizisinin soundtrackinden fırlamış gibi nostaljik, tamamiyle amerikalı, masum ve hoş bir şarkıdır. linda scott söylemektedir, sözlerini yazarsam herhangi bir yazar için küçük kendim için büyük hem de ilk adımı atmış olurum: who's been sleeping in my bed? who's been cryin' on my pillow? who's been tossin', who's been turnin' all night? someone had a bad time, a real, real sad time. won't somebody tell me who's been sleeping in my bed? who's been cryin' on my pillow? looks like there was someone walkin' the floor. if i'm not mistaken, her heart was breakin'. wonder what went wrong. not a single sigh, and i don't know why. all i know is last night we quarreled and you said "good bye" i wish i knew just who's been sleeping in my bed? who's been cryin' on my pillow? who else can it be? it has to be me. i'm the one who's weepin' instead of sleepin'. 'cause you're gone from me. (not a single sigh, and i don't know why) all i know is last night we quarreled and you said "good bye" i wish i knew just who's been sleeping in my bed? who's been cryin' on my pillow? who else can it be? it has to be me. i'm the one who's weepin' instead of sleepin'. 'cause you're gone from me. (not a single sigh) 'cause you're gone from me (and i don't know why) (not a single sigh) 'cause you're gone from me (and i don't know why)
