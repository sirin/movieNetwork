breaking benjamin adlı grubun 2006 tarihli phobia albümünün 10. şarkısı. helikopter pervanesi sesiyle başlar. güzel bi şarkıdır. sözlerini de yazayım tam olsun: borderline, dead inside, i don't mind, falling to pieces count me in, violent, let's begin feeding the sickness how do i simplify, dislocate, the enemies on the way show me what it's like, to dream in black and white, so i can leave this world tonight. full of fear, ever clear, i'll be here fighting forever curious, venomous, you'll find me climbing to heaven nevermind, turn back time, you'll be fine, i will get left behind show me what it's like, to dream in black and white, so i can leave this world tonight. holding on too tight, breathe the breath of life, so i can leave this world behind. it only hurts just once, they're only broken bones, hide the hate inside (so i can leave this world behind) show me what it's like, to dream in black and white, so i can leave this world tonight. holding on too tight, breathe the breath of life, so i can leave this world behind
