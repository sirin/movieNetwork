afi'nin 2006 tarihli decemberunderground albumunun 5. sarkisi: forever waiting for disaster. what david calls servant and master, will you play it too? as this displacement begs for water, swimming, bathing, drowning in sorrow, scream with me. i crawl across this cracked expansion. i'll be buried soon beneath the sand with pure intentions, wanting something, someone to follow. for a change i'll refrain from hiding all of me from you. here's my lullaby... pray for rain, lose your name and watch all your dreams fall through. hush now don't you cry. i swoon upon my knees come crashing. will you bury me? today, this small favor i'm asking. hold me. you may drop me tomorrow. for a change i'll refrain from hiding all of me from you. here's my lullaby... pray for rain, lose your name and watch all your dreams fall through. hush now... for a change i'll refrain from hiding all of me from you. pray for rain, lose your name and watch all your dreams fall through. here's my lullaby. hush now don't you cry. calm down. come down, cold resides with me. i flee to, i flee to decemberunderground. as you exhale i breathe in and sink into the waterunderground and i'll grow pale without you.
