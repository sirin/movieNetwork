romance and cigarettes'da da karşımıza çıkan bir bruce springsteen şarkısı. well, brunettes are fine, man blondes are fun but, when it comes to getting the dirty job done, i'll take a red-headed woman, a red-headed woman. it takes a red-headed woman to get a dirty job done. well, listen up, stud, your life's been wasted 'til you've got' down on your knees and tasted a red-headed woman, a red-headed woman. it takes a red-headed woman to get a dirty job done. tight skirt, strawberry hair tell me what you've got, baby, waiting under there. big green eyes that look like, son, they can see every cheap thing that you ever done. well, i don't know how many girls you dated, man you ain't lived 'til you've had your tires rotated by a red-headed woman, a red-headed woman. it takes a red-headed woman to get a dirty job done.
