robert pattinson'ın söylediği şarkının sözleri de şöyle: [considering] the same old you head on fast, but it came on easy now i won't be gone for long, at least i'm going [home] [i'm here for you], now you know what you lost now you are the thieves that you pardoned search for need, it'll never come now you have fallen there's more for their own now sometimes i need a focus, i need a reason this is so long, stray dog you're lonely joker no, joker no more who would reach their own when you can call on your mind crying to hope that tears sometime, they're wasted wasted, all before forget what you came here for and you need to see the signs and you need to stop wasting time start to save that stolen story that you heard before. and i waited for you, but you're long gone stray dog you're only a stray, joker no, joker no more yeah, stray dog
