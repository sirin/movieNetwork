jon bon jovi nin destination anywhere albümünün en güzel şarkısıdır. sözler: i got my call light on gimme one more fare tonight just get me over the bridge i can see those shiny bay lights you know i'm never alone but i'm feeling lonely tonight damn, i got my last cigarette but i ain't got no light god let these wheels roll to where the girls are pretty when the nights explode and life is still living down this open road the arms of pity wait to greet me tonight in little city in my rear view mirror i see someone else's hairline i hear that fire in your eyes is on the rock and doing hard time and the grapes of wrath, they're on the vine there's wine in this dirt here love ain't love it's just another four letter word god let these wheels roll to where the girls are pretty when the nights explode and life is still living down this open road the arms of pity wait to greet me tonight in little city now that cold gray fog's just a rolling down the highway he's come to carry me home it's put a little smile on my face
