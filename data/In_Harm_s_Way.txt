the human factor albümünde yer alan harika metal church balladı... in the empty spaces of the mind, that's here i store my past a ghostly image that i fear has yet to be surpassed i pray that i won't carry all the pain 'till the end no direction from your guardian, the one who should protect i'm innocent of their decisions, i wonder why dad left every night i hide in bed and plan to run away... a lonely child with battered eyes no joy in innocence they cry always has to lie his way through life i've fallen down while playing ball but mom beat me up and down the hall just because she had one of those nights instinct to defend, where does it all end how does a child get himself out of harm's way? a lifelong price to pay it's not that mommy hits that hurts me, it's when she goes away get home from school all by myself and won't see her for days a kid deprived of love in life has no alternative in sight he throws up barriers to get him through a human life's a gift from god your conscience and your heart are gone you're much to cruel to have a point of view no one to turn to, oh, how dare you how does a child get himself out of harm's way? a price no one should pay can't you see the tears they're crying don't you care your kids are dying? from the senseless torment that you put them through there's different kinds of lies to tell abuse is from the pit of hell a demon with a goal that is to kill you better hear the words i say deliverence may be far away you'll look like you have been run through the mill instinct to defend, where does it all end how does a child get himself out of harm's way? a lifelong price to pay
