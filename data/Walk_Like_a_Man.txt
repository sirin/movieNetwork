frankie valli and the four seasons'a ait bir şarkı. 60'ların hemen başından. çok eğlencelidir, 4-5 kişi birlikte söylemek icap eder. ayrıca sleepers filminin de başında çalmaktadır şarkı, hatta bir de son sahnede tüm sleeperlar birlikte söylemektedir bunu, canlı performans edasıyla. woo hoo'lu vokalleri dağıtır, en ince sesinizle söylemeniz gerekir. oh, how you tried to cut me down to size tellin' dirty lies to my friends but my own father said "give her up, don't bother the world isn't comin' to an end" walk like a man, talk like a man walk like a man my son no woman's worth crawlin' on the earth so walk like a man, my son bye bye baby, i don't-a mean maybe gonna get along somehow soon you'll be cryin' on account of all your lyin' oh yeah, just look who's laughin' now walk like a man, fast as i can walk like a man from you i'll tell the world "forget about it, girl" and walk like a man from you

rick springfield'in tao albümündeki şarkılardan. nakarat kısmıyla beni benden alır söyleyemeden edemedim efendim. sözleri de şöyle: i got so many thoughts jumping out of my head and i can't sit still i'm thinking about the universe i'm looking at life on earth i can't shut the camera shutter i stare at the clock, and the years slip away and i stay confused i'm dreaming about la raison d'etre i'm frightened by the toxic threat i can't stop the motor running people saying i should learn some self-control but i just want to exorcise my soul and walk like a man, walk like a man i still feel like a boy and you feel like a girl in my hand i'm gonna walk like a man, walk like a man i'm still waiting on the revelation here in never-never land i got so many things jumpin' out of my brain and i feel so strange i'm crazy about the car i drive while people struggle just to stay alive i can't put the two together i stare in the bathroom mirror at my face god, i look so pale lines crawl across my face i'm runnin in the human race, yeah me first, who am i kidding where is this peace that comes with age someone show me to my cage where i can walk like a man, walk like a man i still feel like a boy and you feel like a girl in my hand i'm gonna walk like a man, walk like a man i'm still waiting on the revelation here in never-never land (when it finally hits me then) (and only then, i'll understand) waiting for the revolution here in never-never land where is this peace that comes with age will somebody take me to the stage where i can walk like a man, walk like a man walk, walk like a man walk like a man walk like a man walk like a man walk like a man walk like a man i still feel like a boy and you feel like a girl in my hand i'm gonna walk like a man, walk like a man i'm still waiting on the revelation here in never-never land (when it finally hits me then) (and only then, i'll understand) waiting for the revolution here in never-never land walk like a man
