counting crows parçası. sakin bir ruh halinde usulca dinlenesi şarkı, zaten sözleri de çok güzel: i took the cannonball down to the ocean across the desert from sea to shining sea i rode a ladder that climbs across the nation fifty million feet of earth between the buried and me "how do you do?" she said, "hey, how do you do?" she buys a ticket 'cause it's cold where she comes from she climbs aboard because she's scared of getting older in the snow love is a ghost train rumbling through the darkness hold on to me darling i've got nowhere else to go "how do you do?" she said, "how do you do?" i took the cannonball down to the ocean watched the diesel disappear beneath the tumbling waves love is a ghost train howling on the radio "remember everything." she said, "when only memory remains." "how do you do?" she said, "hey, how do you do?"
ve justin sullivan'ın bir şarkısı. navigating by the stars'da. sözleri: it's a long warm september and we're both still alive and the sea is like a painting beneath the neon sky raise the dead, raise the dead we'll go riding on the ghost train, together raise the dead through the summer scented shadows, we were frozen in the light and she brushed upon our faces, disappeared into the night raise the dead, raise the dead we'll go riding on the ghost train, together raise the dead
gorillaz'ın kuruluşundan sonra kaydedilen ilk şarkıdır. sözlerini yazmanın kimseye faydası olmayacak, link bence yeterli.
between the buried and me, adını bu counting crows şarkısının sözlerinden almıştır.
