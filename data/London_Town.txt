1978 tarihli wings albümü.deliver your children, with a little luck gibi şarkılarla paul mccartney'in iyice durgunlaştığının işaretini veren albümdür..
paul mccartney in solo kariyerinin 1978 tarihli çıktısıdır. albumde ozellikle london town,cafe on the left bank,i'm carrying,famous groupies, deliver your children ve ozellikle de don't let it bring you down gibi her mccartney albumunde bulunan fakat ' hidden gem' statusunde bulunan ve o anda beatles aftik olsa idi ilk beatles albumune girecek tarzda sarkilarla bezeli album. don't let it bring you down in klasik olmamasi, tamamen muzik piyasasinin bir ayibidir.
ayni albumde yer alan ayni isimli mukemmel paul mccartney sarkisi. silver rain was falling down upon the deadly ground of london town...
1980 senesinden bir light of the world parçası, senelerin eskimeyen jazz funk klasiği.
uzun süre dinlenmeyince özlenen güzel mi güzel bir paul mccartney şarkısı: walking down the sidewalk on a purple afternoon i was accosted by a barker playing a simple tune upon his flute - toot toot toot toot silver rain was falling down upon the dirty ground of london town people pass me by on my imaginary street ordinary people it's impossible to meet holding conversations that are always incomplete well, i don't know oh, where are there places to go someone somewhere has to know i don't know out of work again the actor entertains his wife with the same old stories of his ordinary life maybe he exaggerates the trouble and the strife well, i don't know oh, where are there places to go someone somewhere has to know crawling down the pavement on a sunday afternoon i was arrested by a rozzer wearing a pink balloon about his foot - toot toot toot toot silver rain was falling down upon the dirty ground of london town someone somewhere has to know silver rain was falling down upon the dirty ground of london town
