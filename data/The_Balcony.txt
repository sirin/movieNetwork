bir the rumour said fire şarkısı.
buram buram kings of convenience kokan the rumour said fire şarkısı. şarkıyla tanışmamı sağlayan jack & jones mağazası ve shazam'a şükranlarımı bildiriyorum. işte o sözler: there's a band in our cellar baby and they're playing a song of the drunks in the street and i can hear when they're playing their lovesong cause the kids in the yards stop playing with their toys find more lyrics at www.sweetslyrics.com so take me under the scoolyard there are kids there who got lost their mouths all shouting asphalt and the bodies torn apart there are colours in the air when i fall to the ground i can sence a world of heartache but i love the sound of your hair when it falls down from the pillow late at night on the brink of illusion it's the devil in my eyes waiting for the moment to kill me inside how we'd love to die more often so take my hands love there's a burst inside our minds oooo feel my hands love cause i'm numb from the neck down and there is fire love on the balcony right here and i can see our bodies burning but sence no fear so your mouth tastes like sunshine baby but your eyes are all cool buried in my arms and everything matters for seconds we fall to the floor da da da da da
