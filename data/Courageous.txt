ing. cesur, cesaretli, yürekli, yiğit, mert.
dreadful shadows parcasi. your wrinkled hands reveal the time you can't stop anymore the expression of you eyes is still courageous your lips are pale, your skin is white i thought you'd never fall you're lying motionless in bed courageous inside flies dance around the same old lie i'm giving up your shape oh, i was startled by the words you breathed in your despair you've lost your trust in your own world - in living in times when you were young and strong you could embrace the world you've been so fearless and so sure courageous inside flies dance around the same old lie i'm giving up your shape "but our dreaming was too far beyond reality another time we had to see - we are creeping worms in space too many disappointments made me disintegrate i'm losing hold, losing control - and my world collapsed" it seemed that life came back to you your eyes were blazing bright immortal power seized your body i left you when you fell asleep you wanted to be alone and now i'm sitting next to you you're still courageous inside flies dance around the same old lie i'm giving up your shape "sometimes i'm burning in a fire of lies and agony these waves will never subside and my world will disappear i don't believe in human souls, i had to bury warmth in endless fights against myself my world collapsed"

(bkz: saucony courageous)
gardenian sarkisi, sindustries'den. epey neselidir, girisiyle adami hemen haydin oturmaya mi geldik moduna sokar hic affetmez. yillar once dinlerken nasil cosuyorsak simdi de oyle cosuyoruz. "niye dagildin be gardenian?" diye isyan ediyor ve alin teri degil kopi peyst sozlerini hemen yaziyoruz: existing for chaos to harm conceive and lie twisting all straight answers i'm a fake silently respectfully i move behind your backs secretly suspiciously i create my little lies i seem to have forgotten the truth as well as story nothing no longer adds up regretting my conviction to be as every one hiding my solutions deep in my pride "i am here for you" "i am here for you" no one longer listens i have a hard time to reach out might they have discovered all my wrongs i guess i never realised the problems that i've caused i guess i have myself to blame for trusting all those lies ** i must reach out explain these lies i just don't have the courage to do it at this time i must reach out explain these lies i just don't have the courage to do it at this time
