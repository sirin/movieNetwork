sanki her şeyin en sonunda zamanı on dakikalığına durdurup yazılmış tiny vipers şarkısı: eyes to the east i've begun to see that no one survives the light all light shines too far beyond our eyes it shines for no one and we cannot see what lights light all hail the man who froze his heart and gave us over traded all life for the light all eyes to his face that timeless face that faces no one and we cannot see what he sees all hail the morning she comes to see his eyes don't open all hail the darkness it is ours so i went out walking trying to see what he was talking about and that's about when i broke through i know it's all been broken and the lord's already spoken but he wasn't talking to me he was talking to you i can see the future in the sadness of his plan the future has got me crying today there is life on earth and it may be dancing around all of us well tomorrow is only dying and our love can't find you there at the dawning i've been first and last living slow and living fast always trying to get the best of it all but there is more to life than getting there is more to the beginning than only trying to get your way so i call out to the night though i can see that there's nothing at all i try to say it is not true and i try to take you with me to see all this mystery when the mystery is you no love can find you there at the dawning out into the east there is hounds you cannot see and they've been howling after you now you're keeping pace but the longer they must chase the more they starve for you and don't look back toward me i'm as empty as the sea back before there was life on earth i know i won't look back toward you or this crazy world
