pet shop boys'un 1987 tarihli actually albumunden bir sarki. single olarak cikmamistir ama yeterince meshurdur. "s h o p p i n g, we're shopping" seklindeki nakarati cogu kulaga tanidik gelebilir.
jude law ve sadie frost'un ilk kez biraraya geldikleri, marianne faithfull, sean bean, jonathan pryce ve jason isaacs gibi isimleri de oyuncu kadrosunda barindiran, zamaninda yurt disinda kimi elestirmenlerce "90'larin otomatik portakal'i" diye anilmis*, aradan gecen yillar icerisinde kult niteligi kazanmis, siki bir soundtrack'e sahip (credit to the nation / call it what you want), cekildikten sadece 1,5 veya 2 yil sonrasinda atv'de bir geceyarisi ekrana gelmis, ilginc ve basarili film.

sozleri soyle olan duncan sheik sarkisi: so you wrote me a letter which i thought was really kind i don't recall which song it was but there was one you really liked and you asked me, so innocently, of my inspiration why i write the songs i sing, the reasons why i make them well, nothing here is what it seems i'll risk the wreckage of your dreams it's so that you are always shopping to steal away the cash you're dropping listen to me when i say your fantasies are built to fade so there you are, you're always shopping don't even try, there is no stopping don't misunderstand me, it always makes me smile when i can serenade you as you're rollin' down the aisles on this journey of your souls desire, the paradise of goods you're doing just exactly what i think you should well, nothing here is what it seems i'll risk the wreckage of your dreams it's so that you are always shopping so while you roll you're really rocking listen to me when i say your fantasies are built to fade so there you are, you're always wanting what you don't have is always haunting there's still one thing i have to say - my confession's not complete i've made it sound as if all this has nothing to do with me there surely is not anything further from the truth when i have pretty things to gain and only useless things to lose i wish there were another way but i must keep the wolves at bay i hope that you don't find it shocking rock and roll is built on shopping if you're searching for my soul come check out my chains of gold grab your purse and let's go shopping for lingerie and silky stockings let's go shopping together so that we can find ourselves so that we can buy our selves let's go shopping together 'cause we are always by ourselves 'cause we are always by ourselves let's go shopping together so that we can find ourselves
