çok hoş melodiye sahip bir the raconteurs şarkısı. sözlerini de yazayım tam olsun you look pretty in your fancy dress but i detect unhappiness you never speak so i have to guess you’re not free. there, maybe when you’re old enough you’ll realize you’re not so tough and some days the seas get rough and you’ll see you’re too young to have it figured out you think you know what you’re talking about you think it will all work itself out but we’ll see when i was young i thought i knew you probably think you know too do you? well do you? i was naïve just like you i thought i knew exactly what i wanted to do well, what’s you gonna do? and how have you gotten by so far without having a visible scar? no one knows who you really are they can’t see what’s you gonna do (what’s you gonna do) what’s you gonna do now what’s you gonna do (what’s you gonna do) what’s you gonna do now what’s you gonna do (what’s you gonna do) what’s you gonna do now what’s you gonna do (what’s you gonna do) what’s you gonna do now what’s you gonna do now the only way you’ll ever learn a thing is to admit that you know absolutely nothing oh nothing think about this carefully you might not get another chance to speak freely oh freely maybe when you’re old enough maybe when you’re old enough maybe when you’re old enough you’re not free you’re not free
nickelback'in the state albümünden pek bilinmeyen güzel bi şarkı; sözlerini de yazayım tam olsun she's old enough she knows enough she's thrown up so throw her out to me and i'll treat her like she was mine my belief you got your way and i'll get mine and i can't eat i can't sleep i want to thank you for coming and why do we always laugh while we're in this discussion should have known enough never grown enough alone enough to know my where would be the path i wanted to try if it fairs to be good for me than i'd rather die and i can't eat i can't sleep i want to thank you for coming and why do we always laugh while we're in this discussion black words always lead to something bury her cause her time was cut thin all the while you just stood and stared never cared to help we just got carried away lately it seems like my dreams have started to die it occurred to me on the inside i guess so have i and i can't eat i can't sleep i want to thank you for coming and why do we always laugh while we're in the last ones coming standing here with my two feet enjoy it now cause it won't be some way some how the things that keep me alive aren't livin' here anymore
