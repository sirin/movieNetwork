(bkz: love to deth)
mercyful fate’in 9 albümünün 1. parçası. i'm surrounded by darkness, i'm dying in my bed i don't know if i'm going to survive i open my eyes, but it's so hard to see my last rites i don't believe in heaven, i don't believe in hell so save your god for someone else or save him for yourself in a flick of a second i think i saw a priest listening to my breathing getting weaker all the time he's mumbling words i don't understand my last rites i don't believe in heaven, i don't believe in hell so save your god for someone else or save him for yourself feeling colder, feeling low my blood still running, but running slow oh no... i don't need no priest of yours... oh christ i won't listen to another word from you here i am dying and you act the fool i wish you'd come a little closer so i can reach your cross and end your prayer here i don't believe in heaven, i don' t believe in hell so save your god for someone else or save him for yourself
