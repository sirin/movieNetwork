başrollerinde charlize theron, kevin bacon ve courtney love'un oynadığı, fragmanı kendi başına hoş gözüken ama kendisi hiç belli olmaz gibi duran film...
rage'in 1992 yılında çıkardığı harika albüm: peter "peavey" wagner-bass/vocal manni schmidt-guitars chris ephthimiades-drums shame on you solitary man enough is enough medicine questions take me to the water power and greed the body talks not forever beyond the wall of sleep baby, i'm your nightmare fast as a shark(cover) difference
charlize theron, kevin bacon ve courtney love oynuyor, luis mandoki yonetiyor. astım olan kizlari kacirilan bir ailenin hikayesi anlatiliyor.
ah ah.. springsteen we are the world icin vokal yaparken sadece damarlarini catlatmamis, ilaveten album icin de bu sarkisini vermisti.. sarki aslen jimmy cliff'in(mis) ama kendisi bir konserde cover etmis, sonra da kaydedip bu plaga hediye etmis.. fanlar disinda pesine duseni pek gormedim..
80'lerin soul starı colonel abrams'ın 85 tarihli en bilinen hiti.
charlize theron kevin bacon courtney love ve i am sam'deki küçük kızın başrollerini paylaştığı film. sıradan bir fidye hikayesi olmakla birlikte küçük kız astım hastası.. kevin bacon yine aşmış karizmasıyla gönüllerimizdeki yerini sağlamlaştırmakta filmde..
dvdsinde iki ayrı sonu olan film gerçi çok farklı diiller..deleted scenes kısmının yakınında bi yerlere koyduklarına göre sinemada o kısmı göstermiyecekler sanırım..

kevin bacon ile charlize theron'un hakkını verdiği ancak iğrenç ötesi bir courtney love ile doktor koca ve çok bilmiş küçük kız yüzünden piç olmuş sıradan bir gerilim denemesi. senaryoda da pek çok boşluk mevcut. filmin finali ise kötü ötesi olmuş. kesinlikle vakit kaybı olup, meraklılarına uzak durması önerilir.
kobe tai'nin rol aldigi super porno klasigi.
luis mandoki'nin yönettiği 2002 abd yapımı film. başrollerini charlize theron ve kevin bacon paylaşıyor.
courtney love'un yataktan kalkıp film setine geldiğini tahmin ettiğim, charlize theron, kevin bacon ve ismini bilmediğim küçük kızın oyunculuklarının filmi film yaptığı bir aksiyon-gerilim. yalnız dvdsindeki alternatif son seçeneğinin maksadını ve içeriğini pek anlayabilmiş değilim zira orijinaliyle arasında bir fark göremedim.
aynı zamanda bir bruce springsteen şarkısı sözlerini de yazayım tam olsun seems like i'm caught up in your trap again seems like i'll be wearing the same old chains good will conquer evil and the truth will set me free and i know some day i will find the key i know somewhere i will find the key seems like i've been playing your game way too long seems the game i've played has made you strong when the game is over i won't walk out the loser i know i'll walk out of here again i know someday i'll walk out of here again well now i'm trapped ooh yeah trapped ooh yeah trapped seems like i've been sleeping in your bed too long seems like you've been meaning to do me harm but i'll teach my eyes to see beyond these walls in front of me someday i'll walk out of here again someday i'll walk out of here again trapped ooh yeah trapped ooh yeah trapped ooh yeah trapped ooh yeah seems like i've been playing your game way too long seems the game i've played has made you strong trapped ooh yeah trapped ooh yeah trapped ooh yeah trapped ooh yeah
charles bukowski'nin harika bir şiiri: trapped don't undress my love you might find a mannequin; don't undress the mannequin you might find my love. she's long ago forgotten me. she's trying on a new hat and looks more the coquette than ever. she is a child and a mannequin and death. i can't hate that. she didn't do anything unusual. i only wanted her to.
timmy thomas abinin why can't we live together adlı parçası ile mükemmel bir eküri* oluşturan colonel abrams parçası. favori plakcınızdan "why can't we live together (ben liebrand trapped remix)" deyu edinebilirsiniz.* 04:22 de başlayan samba düdüğü öyle böyle değil haa. demedi demeyin bak, harbiden süperdir.
fahir atakoğlu'nun istanbul in blue albümünden mükemmel ötesi bir parça.

ilk seyrettiğimde konusunu tam anlamadığım bir vivid filmi. evli bir çiftin yaşadığı eve paso kadınlar, erkekler giriyor. kâh kendi aralarında, kâh ev sahipleriyle enteresan pozisyon denemeleri yapıyorlar. gel de çık işin içinden.
