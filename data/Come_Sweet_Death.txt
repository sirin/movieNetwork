voltaireparcasi. where is neil when you need him albumunde yer almaktadir. sozleri: you're like a dream dipped in delirium. you're my destiny and my destruction. i desire you i despair of you. and all endlessly. come sweet death sing me a serenade to wash away the blood that stains every single part of me. come on death play me a symphony then take me for a bite to eat. there's a vendor just down the way. you come to me in my darkest moment. i've no regrets, nothing left to lament. no eerie skull. no scary scythe. you're a pretty face. and a warm embrace. i never dreamed death could be so sweet 'til she came for me. come sweet death sing me a serenade to wash away the blood that stains every single part of me. come on death play me a symphony then take me for a bite to eat. there's a vendor just down the way. take me away. tell the other six, 'don't stay up late, we've gone away on holiday, no need to fear no need to cry just because this is goodbye. goodbye. goodbye, cruel world".
