robert wyatt'in cuckooland albümdeki süper sarki... depresiflere önerilmez... you might have a lot to say. there might be a price to pay. just beware. they might smile and nod their heads, while they wish that you were dead. just beware. your friends might not be what they seem. take it from me, if you're not careful you might get hurt one last time. it's just a warning, beware. don't get caught off your guard. evil lurks in all our hearts. just beware. you won't last very long, even if you are strong. just beware. don't trust anyone. they might be your enemy. if you're not careful, you might get hurt one last time. it's just a warning, beware, beware, beware.

yüz kere üst üste dinlenip de baymayan deftones şarkısıdır. ender gelir böylesi.
insanı en diplere iten, dinletirken düşündürten deftones parçası. yolculuk yapılırken dinlenmesi ayrı bir zevk verir.

o halde sıradaki şarkımız tekno* severler için şurdan gelsin: 666 - i'm your nightmare -how do i get here to sleep? -can you hear me? i'm coming! -where am i? -where do you think you are? -in bed? please let me sleep. -beware, 'cause i'm you nightmare!!! you know it's midnight, and the evil appears in the dark. you try to sleep, to scream, but my terror takes your breath before you'd make it. i'm the prince of darkness. a mighty force that keeps your dreams away. and now you fight to stay awake. but there's no light, no way, nowhere left to run. and i promise i'm the creature you'll see every night. that almost stops your heart. 'cause i'm your nightmare. 'cause i'm your nightmare. (2x) -how do i get here to sleep? -can you hear me? i'm coming! -where am i? -where do you think you are? -in bed? please let me sleep. -beware, 'cause i'm you nightmare!!! 'cause i'm your nightmare. (2x)
