stormbringer albümünde coverdale'in sesini duymadığımız, tamamını hughes'un söylediği kadifeye dokunma hissi veren şarkı.

deep purple- stormbringer albümünden.. called to madonna to give me a line she said boy what have you done passing your time with a holy man talking about the moon and sun but i can't tell the difference between the fool and wise show me a river to follow away from all these lies i've been on my own so long won't you lend me your hand i've been picking up my bones too long won't you understand called to the captain to put me ashore for it looked like no man's land is this the way to follow i cried as i shook his hand he told me had no answer he didn't really hold the key i am a simple man was all he said to me i've been on my own so long won't you lend me a hand i've been out in the cold too long won't you understand i've been on the road so long won't you lend me your hand i've been out in the cold too long won't you understand heard my mother crying she was calling out my name whisper in the dark night saying who's to blame the hour glass keeps turning with not enought sand to see i am a holy man so don't you bother me i've been on my own so long won't you lend me your hand i've been pickin' up my bones too long won't you understand i've been on my own so long won't you lend me your hand i've been out in the cold too long won't you understand?
network filmine acayip benzeyen, hatta remakei falan olduğunu düşündüğüm eddie murphy filmi. o yüzden o güzel söylemler dışında pek bi marifeti yok.
1999 yapımı, pürüzsüz bir eddie murphy komedisi. --- spoiler --- otobanın kenarında çimenlikte beyaz elbiseyle dolaşırken yaptığı hareketler, son derece komplike. bu da komik olması için yetiyor. --- spoiler ---
glenn hughes'un güzelim sesini duyabildiğimiz, epey bir zeppelin vari şarkı. hatta (bkz: your time is gonna come)
