in one last breath you'll feel this damned old soul you'll see the things i see for all these years of pain and sacrifice you'll know the pain i know of all these things i offer unto you infernal wisdom waits now unleashed like the flames of hate my sacrifice is made every note and every word you hear comes from deep within an angry soul that twists and turns inside pondering this life crimson eyes staring through your lies awakes the inner rage take my knife make my sacrifice you¹re my burnt offering spill your blood offer me good omen make the sacrifice, the hours close at hand burn your soul offer me good omen take your very life, this i command dark shadows fall on this sacred ground where true evil lies, summon them to rise take the traitors, thieves and liars feed them to the fire but first, spread their blood around the message will be found walk carefully my friends stab my back again a warning from the sky these are not idle threats my friends we're slaughtering the lambs true vengeance is on the rise the traitors shall be damned cast their bodies to the flames spill your blood offer me good omen make the sacrifice, the hours close at hand burn your soul offer me good omen take your very life, this i command

testament'ın 1987 tarihli the legacy albümünden müthiş gaz bir parça. summoned to the house of seance to play the evil tarot cards to find out what our fate will bring us before the war approaching now the hour of tiamat evil feelings in the air the chosen wait impatiently to find the rituals of power come out of the fire making the legacy known takes its toll at last now knowing when it strikes the endless feuding shows its fate the people are all shocked with fright they know the end is coming near it's time to fight the revolution holds on strong the armies have all met their match entire world up in arms destruction sees the spirits of anger come up from the gallows conjured my demons appear summoned to my cast,prey this deadly mass takin by the fire you fail the world became a vast wasteland survivors turn to cannibals killing everything in sight warfare tonight the armies are all closing in the populations getting small feelings are as cold as ice survival names it's price starting to burn the rape and violence grows high a kingdom will rise to rule with contempt they will surprise kill and repent the weakness in armies "won't die" leaving now the house of seance speculating destiny wonder if the cards were true will wait to find out and will wait to see
çok sağlam giriş melodisi olan döneminin en baba testament şarkılarından.
introsu inanılmaz derecede dantes infernonun bitişine benzeyen efsanevi şarkı.
1:09 da baslayan kisminda dinledigim en iyi thrash metal rifflerinden birini barindiran, dinlemekten bikmadigim guzel bir testament sarkisidir.
