dean martin'in kadınlara ne vaat edip, uygulamada ne yapılması gerektiğine dair reçete hükmünde şarkısı. sözlerini de kopyalayıp yapıştırayım ki eksik kalmasın. promise her diamonds that sparkle like rain promise her orchids and lots of champagne promise her stars in the sky up above promise her anything but give her love promise her perfume and glamorous furs promise her bankbooks that say his and hers promise her things she's been dreaming of promise her anything but give her love you may not be a rich man but you don't need wealth or fame just show her that you really care and she'll love you just the same promise her bracelets of silver and jade promise her servants a butler and maid she'll cuddle up close like a hand in a glove just promise her anything but give her love promise her bracelets of silver and jade promise her servants a butler and amide she'll cuddle up close like a hand in a glove just promise her anything but give her love, love, love promise her anything but give her love
