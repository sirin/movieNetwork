1956 tarihli broadway müzikali. bestecisi jule styne.
lhasa de sela'nın 2009 nisan çıkışlı lhasa albümünün beşinci parçası. bells are ringing bells are ringing all through the drowned town in the empty streets and a hundred miles around bells are ringing birds are flying upside down my heart has been lost for too long bells are ringing ships will be leaving this was my home nothing's moving nothing is breathing bells are ringing ringing me from sleep my sleep was not restful but my dreaming was deep bells are ringing we both know there's nothing left to do but walk out there and go you could lean your head down and rest it on my knee you could tell me a story that does not end this way bells are ringing we both know there's nothing left to do but walk out there and go
akustik haliyle adamı duvara yapıştıran şarkı...
